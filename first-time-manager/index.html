Congratulations! You have just achieved your first milestone! As a first-time Manager, one has to face several obstacles. Even though a higher designation gets you a fancy salary, it also adds to your responsibilities. Remember, “With great power, comes great responsibility.”</p><p>If you have to maintain a reputation in the organization, and earnestly live up to the title of a ‘Manager’ – you have to set your priorities right. It can be nerve wrecking at times, but there is always a first time to experience things – and more experiences add to greater learnings.</p><p>What can I do in my first acquired role as a ‘Manager’?</p><h3>Be an effective listener</h3><p>Everyone can ask questions. Rather, you never run short of people who are willing to talk. In contrast, how many are actually ready to listen? If you are appointed Manager – one of the important traits you must have – is to listen. Listen to everything that is happening around, to the petty grievances of an employee who stops you by the corridor and pay attention to the details discussed in a meeting. As a first-time Manager, the more you listen, the better decisions you make. Very few organizations cultivate managers who can listen – and they are the ones respected and earn the reputation easily in the organization. Every employee is giving you answers each day - learn to listen.</p><h3>Delegate Tasks</h3><p>If you think as a Manager, you are the only one completing all the tasks – you are mistaken. As a first-time Manager, you are tested on your ability to delegate tasks to your team. Have you been able to identify your team members correctly?  If you are well versed with your team members, you know exactly the knack of delegation. Delegating tasks involves getting the entire team to work together effectively. As a manager, you are required to incorporate teamwork, which is managed effectively through delegation. A Manager is viewed as an individual who can get work done through other people.</p><h3>Lead by Example</h3><p>If you are appointed Manager, remember that you are stepping into a leadership role. A leader is defined as an individual who can lead a team effectively. Set an example for your team. Be cautious about your conduct and the manner in which you deal with situations and people. Your team quickly adopts your behavior. If you are able to maintain a calm, compose nature, and get work done – you are setting an example for your employees under you.</p><p>Therefore, lead by example. Set rules and regulations and lead your team to work in harmony.</p><blockquote>“Leadership is not a position or a title; it is an action and example.”</blockquote><h3>Develop your team positively</h3><p>As a Manager, you are required to manage emotional quotients of people at work as well. Extreme pressure to meet targets and get work done can demotivate employees. Who is responsible to fix this? As Manager, you have to keep motivating your team to work harder. Focus on developing a positive environment. Communicate with your employees to understand their major concerns and difficulties while working. Most importantly, do not forget to appreciate and acknowledge your employees when they accomplish any task at work. “A person who feels appreciated will always do more than what is expected.”</p><p>In case of any crisis, you Manager will be the first one to know about it – prepare your team in advance. Strive to work towards creating a positive environment at your workplace – this will lead to increased efficiency and positive work relations. Remember that, an employee’s motivation is a direct result of the sum of interactions with his/her manager.</p><h3>Get a Mentor</h3><p>There are times, as a first-time Manager, you find yourself in a fix. You need help and guidance – how can you find a solution to this?</p><p>In times of mergers and acquisitions, and major organizational decisions – you cannot rely on your intuition to arrive at a decision. You need assurance that the decisions you are taking are the right ones, even in the case of resolving workplace conflicts.</p><p><a href="https://coachfederation.org/blog/new-research-highlights-millennial-leaders-first-time-managers-need-succeed">The International Coach Federation</a> (ICF) and Human Capital Institute (HCI), <strong>Lexington, Kentucky, USA</strong> have released findings from their latest research collaboration, <em>Building a Coaching Culture with Millennial Leaders</em>. The study explores how first-time people managers and emerging leaders—many of whom are Millennials—can benefit from collaborating with a coach and receiving training on how to use coaching skills with their peers and teams. Most respondents demonstrated an understanding that managers and leaders who use coaching skills are more effective in their roles. When asked to describe the most effective management style, two words respondents cited most frequently were “collaborative” and “coaching.”</p><p>Seek a mentor. Most companies have adopted Mentorship at all levels – you’d be surprised but even a CEO of a company seeks advice from his/her own Mentor. Collaborating with Mentors can help you make decisions effectively and wisely. At the same time, you feel lighter while sharing your set of burdens with someone else. As human beings, we are all dependent on another and in circumstances like these – it is advisable to be dependent. Your mentor will be a person who has experienced the similar set of struggles and can definitely advise you substantially.</p><p>As a first-time Manager, the lessons you learn will take you places – make the most of this experience and learn wisely!</p><blockquote>“A good manager finds satisfaction in helping other’s be productive, not being the most productive person in the room.”</blockquote><p><em>Image Credit: <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/smiling-female-business-leader-with-arms-crossed_1115786.htm">Freepik</a></em></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://wa.me/?text=First-Time%20Manager%3F%20Here%20are%205%20Things%20to%20Follow https%3A%2F%2Fguide.makemyresume.co.in%2Ffirst-time-manager%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Share with WhatsApp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fguide.makemyresume.co.in%2Ffirst-time-manager%2F&amp;title=First-Time%20Manager%3F%20Here%20are%205%20Things%20to%20Follow" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><ul class="post__tag box"><li><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/tags/career/" class="u-tag u-tag--1" title="Career">Career</a></li></ul><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/goal-setting/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Goal Setting -
