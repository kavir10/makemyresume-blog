However, if you have taken enough time to plan the process out, you are surely headed the right way. According to a journal article in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1879403?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Economics of Information and Job Search</a>,  in a labor market characterized by uncertainty, both employers and employees are searching. A <a href="https://talent.works/blog">survey</a> states that, despite some challenges in the market, the fact is there’s a pretty significant increase in jobs available now than in previous years — over 200% in certain industries<em>.</em></p><p>Just follow the simple steps to a Definite Action Plan for your Job Search</p><h2>Know your strengths and weaknesses</h2><p>This point is crucial, not just before planning a job search, but also until you land an interview with any organization. One must be able to identify their strengths and weaknesses at the earlier stage. If your strength lies in excellent communication - you know you'd easily fit into roles like PR, Sales, Trainer. Moreover, identifying your weaknesses before a job search can buy you enough time to build on those weaknesses and convert them into strengths.</p><h2>Start your initial search</h2><p>What exactly would an initial search include? Do you know how to look up jobs on a job portal? Are you well informed about the various jobs that exist on job portals? Are you aware of the right keywords you can use to get the right jobs? One needs to be thorough with the initial homework. An initial homework would include the use of the right keywords, knowledge of the various job portals along with the job postings.</p><p>Moreover, have you studied the market well for the field you've chosen? Do you know the designation that exists for the type of job you're seeking? Hence, an initial search is crucial. It's a virtual peek into the market. Also, it is done to get you familiarised with the type of jobs that exist in the market. Moreover, you get introduced to job descriptions, which state the roles and responsibilities of the candidate an employer is seeking. Don't mess up your initial search, take time out and do it well!</p><h2>Revamp your resume</h2><p>Your resume is your ticket to land a good job. It's simple, if the details on your ticket aren't precise and accurate, you don't get past the boarding gate.  Similarly, your resume needs to state every detail precisely. Do you still hold an outdated resume? Well, then it's time you revamp it.</p><p>If you still think, you can fake a few details on your resume to put up an impressive document - you're wrong. Every detail put on your resume must hold evidence. Update your recent <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-certifications/">certifications</a>, <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-education/">educational qualifications</a>, <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/volunteer-experience-resume/">volunteer experience</a>, and your previous <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/">work experience</a>. Make sure your resume looks fresh.</p><h2>Create a target list of companies</h2><p>We all have that dream list of companies we want to work for. Now is the time you start carving your dream to reality. If you have envisioned working for a particular company, now is the time to make your dreams more realistic. Create a list of companies and make a target list. Put Google to the best use and research about those companies. This extends your knowledge concerning the organization you're targeting, and when you land an interview with the same organization - you're best placed to answer any questions the interviewer throws at you regarding the organization.</p><p>Don't let the interviewer have an impression that you haven't done your homework well. Knowing about the organization you wish to work for will always give you an edge over the other applicants.</p><h2>Create your online presence (LinkedIn)</h2><p>What does a platform like LinkedIn do? Do you think it enhances your job search? Well, LinkedIn is one of the most widely known platforms to explore your job opportunities. LinkedIn connects you to different employers around the globe, where you have the opportunity to explore your choices. If you intend to get noticed by the well-known employers on LinkedIn, it is really important to create an online presence before you venture into the application process.</p><p>Take time out and build your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn provides you with various sections, where the right amount of information can get you to the right employer. Increase your reach, so when recruiters look up your profile, they aren't spending time browsing - Your profile is out there among the top searches! LinkedIn also provides you with a section to look out for jobs. All you do is enter your preferred designation, for eg: Manager with your preferred location. Do you see how creating an online presence can multiply your chances of getting closer to your dream job?</p><h2>Attend Networking Events</h2><p>Networking is the ultimate answer to a successful corporate journey. Why not kickstart your corporate journey with networking? Networking will fairly introduce you to the corporate world. You get to the event, meet designated people from different organizations, understand how businesses function. Moreover, you are also learning about the kind of businesses that exist in the market.</p><p>Don't completely resort to networking virtually. Get out there and network with different people. Besides, you also increase your scope of learning in terms of the kind of certifications you need for the right kind of job. Plenty of networking events are hosted all over. Skip a Friday night party and attend a networking event - you won't regret it!</p><p><em>Image Credit: Unsplash</em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 27, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fjob-search-definite-action-plan%2F&amp;title=Job%20Search%20-%20Definite%20Action%20Plan" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Job%20Search%20-%20Definite%20Action%20Plan https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fjob-search-definite-action-plan%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/resume-skills-what-to-highlight-on-a-resume/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Resume Skills: What to highlight on a Resume?</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/resume-preparedness-for-interviews/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How to Prepare for Interviews starting with your Resume  </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-11-13T17:09" class="feed__date">November 13, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/boost-your-resume-with-strong-action-words/" class="invert">Boost your Resume with Strong Action Words</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2021 Quantum Careers Tech Pvt Ltd</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
