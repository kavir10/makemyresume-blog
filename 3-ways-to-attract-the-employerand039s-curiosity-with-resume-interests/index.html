Not just to make sure our <a href="http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-accomplishments/">accomplishments</a> are in place, but also to craft our interests accurately.</p><p>"I love travelling, taking photographs and long walks on the beach." Let's admit it - we've all been there. However, finding interesting things to say about yourself isn't that easy. Most experts say that listing your hobbies or interests in the resume isn't essential. However, as a matter of fact, IT IS! It might just be the next thing that will <a href="http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/08/infographic-need-great-resume/">catch the employers attention</a> and land you an interview.</p><p>However, before you choose to add a list of interests, know these 3 things:</p><h2>When to include a list of hobbies on your resume?</h2><p>An organization isn't looking for a set of robots to sit and work the entire day. They need someone who will blend with their work culture. Organizations are moving towards more number of <a href="http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/08/employee-engagement-employ-engage-engross/">employee engagement</a> activities, and if it lies within your interest, you're hired! Furthermore, organizations can be hiring people gauging their fun side too.</p><p>For Eg:<em> Google hires people who are open and playful</em></p><h2>What hobbies work best in a resume?</h2><p>Your hobbies and interests convey an important message to the hiring manager. They say a lot about you as an individual. Thus, choose the ones that interest the employer and convey a lot about yourself.</p><p>Know what most common interests can mean -</p><ul><li><strong>Individual Sports (Marathon Running)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You're fit and you enjoy challenges.</em></li><li><strong>Team Sports (Basketball)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You excel at teamwork and have leadership skills.</em></li><li><strong>Extreme Sports (Motocross)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>A risk taker (bad for desk jobs).</em></li><li><strong>Tech Hobbies </strong><strong>(Computing)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>Tech savvy and introverted (not great for social jobs).</em></li><li><strong>Puzzles (Crosswords)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You're an analytical thinker with problem-solving skills.</em></li><li><strong>Games (Chess)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You're an intelligent strategist.</em></li><li><strong>Social Hobbies (Mentoring)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You communicate well and connect with others.</em></li></ul><h2>How to add examples of your hobbies and interests on your resume?</h2><p>You may be a really talented individual and may want to add a lot of hobbies or interests on your resume. Hang on there, first of all, research about the company to check on their work culture. Would they find unique hobbies on your resume valuable?</p><p>Do a quick test -</p><p><strong>Start </strong>with reading<strong> </strong>the job description. Most job offers will have a list of traits that companies want the employees to have.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, take a quick look around their website. Moreover, pay attention to any employee profiles.</p><p><strong>Third, </strong>check social media accounts like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.</p><p><strong>End</strong> with checking out the company reviews on sites like <em><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glassdoor</a></em>.</p><p>Don't ignore your interests, they make a difference too. Work on customizing it - interest your employer!</p><p><em>Image Credit: Freepik</em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 26, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2F3-ways-to-attract-the-employerand039s-curiosity-with-resume-interests%2F&amp;title=3%20Ways%20to%20Attract%20the%20Employer%26%23039%3Bs%20Curiosity%20with%20Resume%20Interests" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=3%20Ways%20to%20Attract%20the%20Employer%26%23039%3Bs%20Curiosity%20with%20Resume%20Interests https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2F3-ways-to-attract-the-employerand039s-curiosity-with-resume-interests%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/follow-3-simple-tips-to-showcase-accomplishments-in-the-resume/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Follow 3 Simple Tips to Showcase Accomplishments in the Resume</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/6-expert-tips-to-write-a-great-resume-work-experience/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> 6 Expert Tips to Write a Great Resume Work Experience </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-03-27T11:10" class="feed__date">March 27, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/internship-application-get-interview-calls-with-your-resume/" class="invert">Internship Application - Get Interview Calls with your Resume</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-03-12T11:23" class="feed__date">March 12, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/difference-between-professional-resume-and-visual-resume/" class="invert">Difference between Professional Resume and Visual Resume</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-03-01T15:18" class="feed__date">March 1, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/difference-between-cv-and-resume/" class="invert">Difference between CV and Resume</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
