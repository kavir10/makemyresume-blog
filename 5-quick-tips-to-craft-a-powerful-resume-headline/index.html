A resume headline is important in communicating to the reader the exact position you are interested in and what sets you apart as a candidate. Excluding a headline, a recruiter or hiring manager will spend too much time digging through your resume or make an educated guess as to what you want to do.</p><p>A headline needs to be an ideal mix of what you want to convey but precisely. It has to have the right match of words that sum up your profile the best.</p><h2>#5 Quick Tips to create a good Resume Headline</h2><h2>#1 Keep it Concise</h2><p>Your resume headline must contain the exact mix of words. However, it can't be jargons and complex sentences. The headline has to be concise. The goal of a headline is to state your value as a candidate. Anything longer defeats the purpose of a headline.</p><h2>#2 Capitalize your Headline</h2><p>One smart trick to create an impressive headline is to capitalize on the words in your headline. This will make for a good title for your resume. Focus on the keywords in your entire resume that will aid in creating a headline that stands out.</p><p>A good headline will be whatever that is most relevant for the role that you are applying to. It makes sense to add that you are an Electronics and Communications major applying to a Marketing position.</p><p><em>Eg: Digital Marketing Aspirant | IIT-B</em></p><h2>#3 Avoid Clichés</h2><p>Your resume headline can't be a mix of cliché words. The purpose of creating a good headline is to ensure that your resume stands out from the others. Avoid cliché words like 'hard worker', 'good communicator' - these words appear on every other resume.</p><h2>#4 Use Keywords</h2><p>Draft your headline using keywords related to your skills and <a href="http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/">work experience</a>. You can also use keywords related to the job listing, and those that apply to your profile. The use of keywords will demonstrate how fit you are for the job you intend to apply.</p><p>Eg: Software Support, IT Professional</p><h2>#5 Use a New Headline for Each Job</h2><p>It may be a little extra work, but use a new headline for each job application. This effort also gives the hiring manager an impression that you have taken time and tailor-made a headline for each respective role. After you thoroughly read the job listing, make sure you list down the skills and attributes required. Consequently, this will aid in creating an innovative headline for each job application you put in.</p><p>Thus, a Headline adds great value to not only your resume but also creates an excellent first impression for the hiring manager. A resume is <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/06/resume-writing-tips/">not just any piece of paper</a>, just as the headline is not just a mix of random words on your resume. Take the effort, go an extra mile, and create a good resume headline.</p><p><em>Image Credit: <a href="http://freepik.com">Freepik</a></em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 26, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2F5-quick-tips-to-craft-a-powerful-resume-headline%2F&amp;title=5%20Quick%20Tips%20to%20Craft%20a%20Powerful%20Resume%20Headline" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=5%20Quick%20Tips%20to%20Craft%20a%20Powerful%20Resume%20Headline https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2F5-quick-tips-to-craft-a-powerful-resume-headline%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/believe-you-can-soar-know-everything-about-pursuing-a-higher-education/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Believe you can soar – Know everything about pursuing a higher education</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/put-your-career-path-to-words-in-the-resume-objective/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Put your Career Path to Words in the Resume Objective </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-08-09T11:32" class="feed__date">August 9, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/infographic-hereand039s-why-you-need-a-great-resume/" class="invert">INFOGRAPHIC: Here&amp;#039;s Why You need a Great Resume</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-03-27T11:10" class="feed__date">March 27, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/internship-application-get-interview-calls-with-your-resume/" class="invert">Internship Application - Get Interview Calls with your Resume</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-03-12T11:23" class="feed__date">March 12, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/difference-between-professional-resume-and-visual-resume/" class="invert">Difference between Professional Resume and Visual Resume</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
