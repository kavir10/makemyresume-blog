And with that come several perks- in addition to providing a boost to your career. In the words of Simon Mainwaring –</p><blockquote>“<em>The simple act of saying<strong> ‘thank you’</strong> is a demonstration of gratitude in response to an experience that was meaningful to a customer of citizen.”</em></blockquote><p>And going by that, it can be said that <strong>thank you letters</strong> can definitely help you cement a good relationship with clients, vendors or even in getting an eventual job offer. So, let us talk about <strong>thank you letters</strong> - more importantly, how they are of help in job interviews.</p><h3>Thank-you letters for job interviews</h3><p>One might ask- <em>"How do<strong> thank-you letters</strong> help in case of <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2017/02/ace-the-behavioural-interview/">job interviews</a>?" </em>Well, to answer in a practical way, it is courteous to do that. It is actually important to say thank you to an employer after an interview - it helps to reiterate your views to the employers as to how the job interests you. More importantly, <strong>thank-you letters </strong>help to highlight you in a better light <em>(even if your <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2017/03/interview-dos-donts/">interview did not go according to plan</a>)</em> and entrench your position as the best suitable candidate.</p><h3>How to write thank you letters - helpful tips</h3><p>Now that we know the importance of <strong>thank you letters</strong>, let's talk about how to write one in the first place.<strong> Thank you letters</strong> should help you thank everyone - from recruiters to everyone who assisted in your job search. Here are some basic points that you should keep in mind while writing <strong>thank you letters</strong> -</p><ul><li><strong>Knowing who to address the thank you letters to</strong></li><li><strong>It is all about making an impact and standing out</strong></li><li><strong>Take measures to keep it short and simple</strong></li><li><strong>Proofread and spellcheck the thank you letter</strong></li><li><strong>Lastly, remember to actually write the words <em>"thank you"</em> </strong></li></ul><p>Writing <strong>thank you letters</strong> can oftentimes be the key to getting a job offer. In these days of email and online communication, taking the time out to thank your potential employers can <em>(more than anything else)</em> emphasize the fact that you are a well-mannered person. Other than that, it can also reinforce the fact that you want the job. Use your <strong>thank you letter</strong> to address any issues and concerns that came up during the interview. Try to discuss anything of importance that the interviewer might have neglected to ask. And while doing that, restate as to why you want the job, what your qualifications are, how you might be able to contribute positively towards the organisation.</p><p>So, the next time you apply for a job - remember to write a <strong>thank you letter</strong>. And as Alfred Painter had once mentioned -</p><blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><em>"Saying 'thank you' is more than good manners. It is good spirituality"</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/0YbeoQOX89k?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Hanny Naibaho</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/thank-you?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 26, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fthank-you-letters-and-job-interviews%2F&amp;title=Thank%20you%20letters%20and%20Job%20Interviews" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Thank%20you%20letters%20and%20Job%20Interviews https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fthank-you-letters-and-job-interviews%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/resolving-workplace-conflicts/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Resolving Workplace Conflicts</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/difference-between-professional-resume-and-visual-resume/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Difference between Professional Resume and Visual Resume </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-05-23T10:02" class="feed__date">May 23, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/resume-preparedness-for-interviews/" class="invert">How to Prepare for Interviews starting with your Resume </a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-11-27T10:02" class="feed__date">November 27, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/cover-letters-what-makes-a-good-one/" class="invert">Cover letters - What makes a good one?</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2021 Quantum Careers Tech Pvt Ltd</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
