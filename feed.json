No errors, no comedy</h3>\n<p>Spoiling your first impression is the last thing you want to do in an interview. Make sure your resume doesn’t become the culprit here. Check your resume thoroughly for spelling errors, inconsistencies, accuracy of information, and formatting.</p>\n<h3>2. Know your resume</h3>\n<p>You don’t want to come across as someone who has written things only to embellish the resume. Take time and read what you have included in the resume. Contradicting your own resume is not the best way to start a relationship with a prospective employer.</p>\n<h3>3. Go back to the start</h3>\n<p>Take time before the interview and reflect on the chronology of your career. It is a given that every interviewer would want to know about what and how you have performed in your past. These questions are asked with a basic intent of knowing if you are fit for the current role. To be sure that you are not missing out on important information about your career progression, prepare:</p>\n<p>• Chronology of career milestones</p>\n<p>• Responsibilities held in each role</p>\n<p>• Achievements in each role</p>\n<p>• Skills pertinent to each profile</p>\n<p>• Learnings derived from each position held</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>• Reason for moving away from a role or an organisation</p>\n<h3>4. Establish trust</h3>\n<p>An interviewer is likely to hire you when they are convinced that the role on offer needs a person like you. The skills and experience detailed in your resume may lay the grounds, but making it through still remains a function of <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2017/07/selling-yourself-effectively-interview/\">how you sell yourself</a>. You must be able to portray alignment between the skills that you have already acquired and the ones that are requisite for the role you are interviewing for. You must guide the interviewer to see how you and your experience can be of particular use to the organisation.</p>\n<h3>5. Practice story telling</h3>\n<p>The interviewer is likely to deep dive into a few roles performed by you, mostly into the ones that seem relevant to the current job description. We recommend that you build up convincing stories around each role. This will also help in establishing trust with the interviewer.</p>\n<p>Think of and elaborate on situations where you displayed qualities like problem-solving, critical thinking, leadership, or team work. Try and talk about qualities that are crucial to the profile on offer, in a subtle yet impactful manner.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, don’t mention anything that you have never done. Overstating is likely to do more harm than good.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Your resume should be error free and you should know each detail you have mentioned therein</li>\n<li>Walk the interviewer through your professional journey</li>\n<li>Research the role and the organisation</li>\n<li>Align your skills to the role and your qualities to those valued by the company</li>\n<li>Build trust with the interviewer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image credits: flazingo.com</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

One must be able to identify their strengths and weaknesses at the earlier stage. If your strength lies in excellent communication - you know you'd easily fit into roles like PR, Sales, Trainer. Moreover, identifying your weaknesses before a job search can buy you enough time to build on those weaknesses and convert them into strengths.</p>\n<h2>Start your initial search</h2>\n<p>What exactly would an initial search include? Do you know how to look up jobs on a job portal? Are you well informed about the various jobs that exist on job portals? Are you aware of the right keywords you can use to get the right jobs? One needs to be thorough with the initial homework. An initial homework would include the use of the right keywords, knowledge of the various job portals along with the job postings.</p>\n<p>Moreover, have you studied the market well for the field you've chosen? Do you know the designation that exists for the type of job you're seeking? Hence, an initial search is crucial. It's a virtual peek into the market. Also, it is done to get you familiarised with the type of jobs that exist in the market. Moreover, you get introduced to job descriptions, which state the roles and responsibilities of the candidate an employer is seeking. Don't mess up your initial search, take time out and do it well!</p>\n<h2>Revamp your resume</h2>\n<p>Your resume is your ticket to land a good job. It's simple, if the details on your ticket aren't precise and accurate, you don't get past the boarding gate.  Similarly, your resume needs to state every detail precisely. Do you still hold an outdated resume? Well, then it's time you revamp it.</p>\n<p>If you still think, you can fake a few details on your resume to put up an impressive document - you're wrong. Every detail put on your resume must hold evidence. Update your recent <a href=\"https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-certifications/\">certifications</a>, <a href=\"https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-education/\">educational qualifications</a>, <a href=\"https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/volunteer-experience-resume/\">volunteer experience</a>, and your previous <a href=\"https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/\">work experience</a>. Make sure your resume looks fresh.</p>\n<h2>Create a target list of companies</h2>\n<p>We all have that dream list of companies we want to work for. Now is the time you start carving your dream to reality. If you have envisioned working for a particular company, now is the time to make your dreams more realistic. Create a list of companies and make a target list. Put Google to the best use and research about those companies. This extends your knowledge concerning the organization you're targeting, and when you land an interview with the same organization - you're best placed to answer any questions the interviewer throws at you regarding the organization.</p>\n<p>Don't let the interviewer have an impression that you haven't done your homework well. Knowing about the organization you wish to work for will always give you an edge over the other applicants.</p>\n<h2>Create your online presence (LinkedIn)</h2>\n<p>What does a platform like LinkedIn do? Do you think it enhances your job search? Well, LinkedIn is one of the most widely known platforms to explore your job opportunities. LinkedIn connects you to different employers around the globe, where you have the opportunity to explore your choices. If you intend to get noticed by the well-known employers on LinkedIn, it is really important to create an online presence before you venture into the application process.</p>\n<p>Take time out and build your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn provides you with various sections, where the right amount of information can get you to the right employer. Increase your reach, so when recruiters look up your profile, they aren't spending time browsing - Your profile is out there among the top searches! LinkedIn also provides you with a section to look out for jobs. All you do is enter your preferred designation, for eg: Manager with your preferred location. Do you see how creating an online presence can multiply your chances of getting closer to your dream job?</p>\n<h2>Attend Networking Events</h2>\n<p>Networking is the ultimate answer to a successful corporate journey. Why not kickstart your corporate journey with networking? Networking will fairly introduce you to the corporate world. You get to the event, meet designated people from different organizations, understand how businesses function. Moreover, you are also learning about the kind of businesses that exist in the market.</p>\n<p>Don't completely resort to networking virtually. Get out there and network with different people. Besides, you also increase your scope of learning in terms of the kind of certifications you need for the right kind of job. Plenty of networking events are hosted all over. Skip a Friday night party and attend a networking event - you won't regret it!</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Unsplash</em></p>",

How is the recruiter going to decide if your application is better than the hundreds of them she has received?</p>\n\n<h2>Skills on your Resume</h2>\n<p>When it comes to the first impression, the one that determines your resume's fate, the skills listed on your resume are crucial in beating the competition and landing that interview. Moreover, the problem is most advice on crafting your resume skills is outdated and ineffective.</p>\n<h2>Why your Resume Skills Matter?</h2>\n<p>A common misconception found among job seekers is, just find a skill from the job description, drop it in your resume - and Voila! The interviews will start pouring in. Unfortunately, that may have happened in the past. We're living in the new era and it's not that simple anymore!</p>\n<p>You certainly don't want to sound like every other job seeker. Furthermore, you don’t want to be another <em>“quick learner with a passion for collaborating with others to solve problems</em>” because that doesn’t tell your employer anything new. They’ve already seen a million of those come across their desk.</p>\n<p>So how do we position ourselves to ensure our Resume stands out? Follow the simple strategies -</p>\n<h3><strong>Strategy 1</strong></h3>\n<p>List six to twelve skills that the candidate possesses that are important to his/her success. The listed skills should be \"level-appropriate\", i.e. don't list skills that are obvious or would be assumed for your level.</p>\n<h3><strong>Strategy 2</strong></h3>\n<p>For Mid to Senior level professionals, add only professional skills. Likewise, refrain from adding very general skills like team management. It is not noteworthy to include skills which are bare necessities. Furthermore, for Freshers and Junior level candidates, personal skills can be included.</p>\n<p>An appropriate structure to display your skills on your resume is shown below-</p>\n<p>For Eg: <em><strong>Brand Management             Luxury Brands             Marketing</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>             Public Relations                   Social Media                  Event Management </strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://freepik.com\">Freepik</a></em></p>",

It is what it is. Although, sometimes it can make things cloudy.</p>\n<p>Follow these <strong>quick six tips</strong> to note down your education in the resume. They'll help you decide what to include, what to leave out, and what to do about the school you attended but didn't graduate.</p>\n\n<h2>Tip 1: List your Highest Level of Education first in your Resume</h2>\n<p>\nIf you've got a master's degree, you start with that and then go back to your bachelors. Ideally, if you've earned a Master's degree or higher, it's okay to leave out your high school education.</p>\n<p><em>For Eg: </em>\n<em><b>Master of Science in Information Technology, </b>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 2007</em></p>\n<p><em><b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, </b>University of Mumbai, 2005</em></p>\n<h2>Tip 2: Selectively include your GPA &amp; Percentages</h2>\n<p>\nBe sure to include your GPA only if it's higher than 3.0 and it's been less than three years since you graduated. The same applies to percentages, keep it to a first class. However, make an exception if the employer especially asks for your grades.</p>\n<h2>Tip 3: Mention Academic Honors and Leadership Roles</h2>\n<p>\nIf you graduated within three years, it's is appropriate to include your academic honors or any leadership roles you have undertaken. However, leave them aside if they are religious, political or controversial. Furthermore, if you have more than three years of work experience, you can drop the school-related activities on your resume, unless they were awarded.</p>\n<h2>Tip 4: If you attended college, but did not Graduate</h2>\n<p>\nIf you have attended college but did not graduate - yes this can be the case for some. Include the dates you attended, your accumulated credits towards the degree.</p>\n<h2>Tip 5: Earned a Certification/License after Graduation</h2>\n<p>\nIf you've earned a license after graduation, and it's related to the job you're pursuing - make sure you add it to your resume under certifications or the license section.</p>\n<h2>Tip 6: Elimination of graduation year if you're older</h2>\n<p>\nDo you eliminate your graduation dates of you're older than forty years? It's a judgment you can take for yourself. By that age, you have accumulated enough <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/\">work experience</a>, that your academics may not seem important. However, it's advisable to include your graduation and higher degrees, if any. The inclusion of years is a call you make.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Freepik</em></p>\n",

Furthermore, as more companies begin to embrace social responsibility, job seekers with exposure to community involvement are more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>Add your Volunteer Experience in three simple steps-</p>\n<h2>Choose the Right Format</h2>\n<p>You usually feature your most relevant <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/\">work experience</a> at the top. This means that your volunteer work experience should go towards the bottom. Don't worry too much about your volunteer work getting missed, most recruiters <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/08/infographic-need-great-resume/\">scan resumes</a> and look at section headers, tenures and job titles. Thus, your volunteer work is less likely to get missed!</p>\n<p>If your volunteer work is directly related to the job you're applying for, include your volunteer work with your paid positions. However, ensure to add the title <em>\"Volunteer\"</em></p>\n<p><em>For Eg: \"Volunteer Social Media Manager\"</em></p>\n<h2>Keep it Concise (But, Make it Count!)</h2>\n<p>There will be space constraints to this section, so make sure you add relevant content. Be selective and think about what will be most impactful to the role or company you're targetting. If you don't have a lot of room to spare, summarize your experience in a line or two. You could also add bullet points to break your experience down.</p>\n<p><em>For Eg: </em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Fundraising Volunteer | Non-Profit Organization | Mumbai | March 2017</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Sourced 50K in donations in a single month through a cold calling, door knocking, and email campaign.</em></p>\n<h2>Note the Exceptions</h2>\n<p>One important caution - Volunteering for a certain organization may give away too much personal information than you're ready to share with your prospective employer.</p>\n<p>It's unfair, but it's the reality. So, you may want to leave out the potentially revealing volunteer work.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://freepik.com\">Freepik</a></em></p>",

Consequently, a resume summary, at a glance, gives your hiring manager a synopsis of your professional qualifications. Basically, it gives the employer a feeler of what you bring to the table.</p>\n\n<p>When writing a resume summary, be sure to include valid information. Moreover, the information included should be concrete and substantiated by evidence in the <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/\">work experience</a> section. It must convey how you have added value to the companies and aided in the transformation of departments.

Why should an organization hire you?</p>\n<p>In about four sentences, you should be able to highlight your most relevant strengths, skillset and core competencies that are unique to your candidature. In particular, demonstrate how will you add value to the company? Have you saved money for your organization in the past? Did you streamline any administrative processes? Moreover, include relevant skills and <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/\">experiences</a> that will impress the employer.</p>\n<p>Draw emphasis from your <a href=\"https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/10/resume-objective-tips/\">resume objective</a> and frame your summary round it.

Furthermore, it should convey what skills you have developed, where your strengths lie and what you have achieved.</p>\n<p>Make that work experience look effective on your resume, follow these simple steps</p>\n\n<h2>Reverse Chronological Order</h2>\n<p>When you start with noting down your work experience, make sure to begin each item by stating the name of the place, location, and the Job Title (Eg: Manager, director, etc.) Consequently, list your experiences in reverse chronological order.</p>\n<h2>Focus on Strong Words</h2>\n<p>Describe your responsibilities in strong words. Consequently, use concise statements. Avoid jargons. Even more, focus on the strengths and skills that you possess and that you have identified as being important to your field. Likewise, try to incorporate industry-specific words. Show the potential employers how exactly you will fit their position and company.</p>\n<h2>Vary Action Verbs</h2>\n<p>Be sure to vary the use of your <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-action-words/\">action verbs</a> while writing your description. You don't want all your descriptions to sound the same. Use past perfect tense for all the activities you have performed. Furthermore, avoid using 'I' and the use of any prepositions.</p>\n<h3>Quantify Responsibilities in your Work Experience</h3>\n<p>Whenever possible, quantify your responsibilities. Use numbers, dollar amounts, values, percentages.</p>\n<p><em>For Eg:  \"Increased monthly sales by forty percent.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Supervised and trained five new employees.\"</em></p>\n<h2>Avoid Summarizing your Organization</h2>\n<p>Avoid summarizing the organization you worked with, or are currently associated with. The crux of the work experience is to focus on the role you performed, not on the organization itself.</p>\n<h2>Limit your Description</h2>\n<p>You can't have a never-ending description. Know what exactly to add, and limit your description to three or four most important points.</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://freepik.com\">Freepik</a></em></p>",

It might just be the next thing that will <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/08/infographic-need-great-resume/\">catch the employers attention</a> and land you an interview.</p>\n\n<p>However, before you choose to add a list of interests, know these 3 things:</p>\n<h2>When to include a list of hobbies on your resume?</h2>\n<p>An organization isn't looking for a set of robots to sit and work the entire day. They need someone who will blend with their work culture. Organizations are moving towards more number of <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/08/employee-engagement-employ-engage-engross/\">employee engagement</a> activities, and if it lies within your interest, you're hired! Furthermore, organizations can be hiring people gauging their fun side too.</p>\n<p>For Eg:<em> Google hires people who are open and playful</em></p>\n<h2>What hobbies work best in a resume?</h2>\n<p>Your hobbies and interests convey an important message to the hiring manager. They say a lot about you as an individual. Thus, choose the ones that interest the employer and convey a lot about yourself.</p>\n<p>Know what most common interests can mean -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Individual Sports (Marathon Running)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You're fit and you enjoy challenges.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Team Sports (Basketball)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You excel at teamwork and have leadership skills.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Extreme Sports (Motocross)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>A risk taker (bad for desk jobs).</em></li>\n<li><strong>Tech Hobbies </strong><strong>(Computing)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>Tech savvy and introverted (not great for social jobs).</em></li>\n<li><strong>Puzzles (Crosswords)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You're an analytical thinker with problem-solving skills.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Games (Chess)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You're an intelligent strategist.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Social Hobbies (Mentoring)</strong><em><strong> - </strong>You communicate well and connect with others.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to add examples of your hobbies and interests on your resume?</h2>\n<p>You may be a really talented individual and may want to add a lot of hobbies or interests on your resume. Hang on there, first of all, research about the company to check on their work culture. Would they find unique hobbies on your resume valuable?</p>\n<p>Do a quick test -</p>\n<p><strong>Start </strong>with reading<strong> </strong>the job description. Most job offers will have a list of traits that companies want the employees to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, take a quick look around their website. Moreover, pay attention to any employee profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Third, </strong>check social media accounts like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p><strong>End</strong> with checking out the company reviews on sites like <em><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glassdoor</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Don't ignore your interests, they make a difference too. Work on customizing it - interest your employer!</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: Freepik</em></p>",

Thus, in addition to the <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-action-words/\">action words</a>, you must use numbers to quantify your resume accomplishments.</p>\n\n<p>Here are <strong>3 simple steps</strong> to showcase your accomplishments:</p>\n<h2>The PAR Method</h2>\n<p>To write down accomplishment - oriented bullet points, follow the simple PAR method -</p>\n<p><em>Problem:</em> Identify an issue or responsibility at your current workplace</p>\n<p><em>Action:</em> Discuss how you addressed the issue</p>\n<p><em>Results:</em> What was that outcome of that action?</p>\n<p>If you think that's a lot to accommodate in one bullet point, the example illustrates how it can be done seamlessly.</p>\n<p><em>For eg: Suggested a new tactic to persuade cancelling customers to stay with the company, resulting in a 5% decrease in cancellations</em></p>\n<h2>Quantify your Accomplishments on your Resume</h2>\n<p>There's no true evidence without providing numbers. Thus, even your employer has his/her eyes on your resume to watch out for those numbers. Just using jargons to express your accomplishments is no good. The game of numbers works magic!</p>\n<p>By using numbers in detailing your <a href=\"http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/\">work experience</a>, you are demonstrating your focus as being results-oriented rather than task oriented. Thus, try to obtain as much data that will help you quantify your resume accomplishments. Moreover, use percentages, currency denominations and time to intensify your data.</p>\n<p><em>For Eg: Replace “Responsible for selling products to customers at XYZ Store” to “Increased sales revenue by 30% in three months.” </em></p>\n<h2>Link Industry Examples to your Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>You could have gained experience across several different industries. Must you mention all? Well, if you have made a notable accomplishment in each - then why not? As a Sales Professional, you could have worked across several sectors. Moreover, adding every sale you made gives your employer a reason to hire you.</p>\n<p><em>For Eg: </em></p>\n<p><em>Information Technology</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Consolidated multiple ticketing systems, improving communication and ticket turnover rate by 7%</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Customer Service</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Assist an average of 40 customers per day in finding or selecting items, and provided recommendations that generated $8K in additional revenue</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have missed on your accomplishments till date, now is the time to go back, and refine them - put them down on your Resume!</p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://freepik.com\">Freepik</a></em></p>",
