Content involves creating impact through the use of quantified info, and action verbs &amp; leadership words. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Visuals involve clear demarcation between segments, mindfulness of aspects like fonts, margins, etc. as per industry standards, and adhering to minimalism.</span></p>",

The 3 F’s can be explained as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Function - This is the reason for which you are drafting your resume - is it for getting a new job in the same domain, a new job in a different domain, or simply routine updation? Depending on your reason, your resume can vary vastly!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form(at) - It consists of 2 parts:</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identifying the appropriate type of resume based on the function it has to perform</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mentioning all the relevant sections in the prescribed order, and the information within in its entirety</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(e)Ffectiveness - This element is a consequence of the amalgamation of the Function &amp; Format elements, rather than an independent one in and of itself. It is essentially a metric that dictates whether the final output captures your profile well based on the reason, and if it does so in an appropriate and relevant format!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you follow the 3 F’s of resume writing</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Function - Customization is key to ensuring your resume performs its intended function. When applying to a new job, a short, crisp resume with only details relevant and pertaining to the job application is apt, whereas for resume updation, a long resume with all your professional experience &amp; accomplishments is suggested to provide a detailed overview of your profile!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form(at) - Your resume format needs to be selected based on the domain you’re applying for a position in, as well as the location (if it’s in a different country). Creative &amp; offbeat fields like Marketing, Media &amp; Entertainment, HR, etc. have a lot of emphasis laid on aesthetics, thus a Visual format works best. Conversely, analytical roles in Finance, Operations, Sales, etc. demand more text-heavy Professional resume formats as more quantitative information is required in addition to your general work-ex descriptions. Lastly, if applying to jobs in foreign countries, International resume formats need to be used, as they (most likely) differ from the format used in your domicile of origin.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(e)Ffectiveness - Identifying your resume’s effectiveness is essentially asking yourself these questions:</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the format I used appropriate considering my domain &amp; the prescribed resume length? Should I change it to fit more content, or should I use a more aesthetic one with slightly lesser content?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are all the relevant skills and keywords present, and are they in their right places?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are the content and format cohesive? (For example, you can’t apply for an associate position in a law firm with a visual resume, no matter how appealing it looks or how good your content is)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there a proper flow &amp; continuity from the start through to the end of my resume?</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why should you follow the 3 F’s of resume writing</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Function - When applying to a new job, your resume goes through </span><a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/beat-the-robots-how-to-get-your-resume-past-the-system-into-human-hands\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATS scanning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where keywords relevant to the position being applied to are matched with those on your resume. Thus, it is better to ensure relevant keywords exist, which can be done only if your resume showcases your expertise within the domain rather than a holistic overview. Additionally, your resume mustn’t cross the specified length&lt;link to ‘How many pages should a resume be?’&gt;. On the other hand, if you’re updating your resume, ensure all the tasks, responsibilities &amp; achievements are included while your memory is fresh - it helps provide a wider repository of information to work with, rephrase &amp; restructure later on when you apply to a new position.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form(at) - Adhering to the relevant format does not give you bonus points; it is a hygiene factor. If your format is incorrect, your resume is consigned to the trash without a second look. For example, including your photo and country of origin is extremely common in India; conversely, in the USA, it is frowned upon due to racial discrimination prevention laws there. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(e)Ffectiveness - It answers the ultimate goal (and question) - “Is my resume a near-perfect fit for the JD?” If your answer is yes, you’re good to go and submit the application……..If not, it’s back to the drawing board!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>TL;DR - </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3F’s of resume writing are Format, Function &amp; Effectiveness. The element of Format focuses on the inclusion of all relevant content in the prescribed order, using a format applicable to the role being applied to. Function refers to the reason for which you’re drafting the resume - is it to get a new job in the same domain, a new job in a different domain, or simply routine updation? Your answer dictates the content (and its customization) in the resume. Lastly, effectiveness is the metric that measures the two elements to see if it forms a sensible, cohesive whole, that provides a good overview of your profile while being as close to the perfect fit for the role you’re applying to as possible. </span></p>",

It meant that:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first few words in a sentence are read more than the remainder</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first few lines and sentences have a much higher chance of being read and paid attention to, than those the end of the article</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, resume writers inferred, it made more sense to include your skills and competencies first, as they’re more relevant than the organizations one has worked in, after all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What they failed to account for, unfortunately, is that this article was published </span><strong><i>solely</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for </span><strong><i>poorly designed web-based</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> content on computers, especially for viewers that weren’t fully engaged due to disinterest or paucity of time. </span></p>\n<p><strong><i>Technically</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, these traits apply to recruiters - they’ll most likely be viewing your resume on a screen, and they certainly face a shortage of time; what they seem to have ignored is the operative phrase ‘</span><strong><i>poorly designed’</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, by which the NN Group meant:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A wall of text, with</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No headers, subheaders or other forms of categorization or differentiation in the text</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No bullet points or text formatting like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">italics or </span></i><strong>bold</strong><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to draw your attention</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you’re utterly uninitiated to the art of resume writing, you’d know none of the three apply to resumes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, this F-pattern is not a universal, species-wide trait - in many Arabian and South-east Asian countries, their script is read right to left or even top to bottom! Additionally, this is not the </span><strong><i>only</i></strong><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reading/scanning pattern observed!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the NN group themselves researched &amp; published a </span><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/\"><strong><i>second </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that clearly mentions the fallacy of applying this research to content, and in some cases. even using it as the basis for the same! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They identified and mentioned several other reading patterns such as the </span><strong><i>layer-cake pattern, spotted pattern </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&amp; </span><strong><i>marking pattern</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the NN Group's aim was to incentivize content optimization to prevent this pattern from emerging, this was completely misunderstood and taken as some ironclad tenet to design content around. Sounds reminiscent of Tomorrowland’s premise around the apocalypse! </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is this format used?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it has not been clear enough, the premise for this format is erroneous. It is </span><strong>not to be used unless </strong><strong><i>specifically asked for. </i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, it is useful in three scenarios:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have long periods of employment gaps</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to work in an entirely new industry</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If for some reason you need to showcase your professional skills first and your work experience later on</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all three cases it could help to showcase your professional skills and prioritise them over your work experience;  at least that was the reasoning for this resume format. However there are resume templates that can provide this benefit without resorting to this poor format,  which we shall get to in a moment</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why you should never use this format</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this format makes sense from a user point of view; for recruiters it is a complete waste of time; indeed, they are known to hate it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional formats where your work experience is in a reverse chronological order help recruiters to track your career trajectory - they see your professional growth and development in the skill sets that you possess as well as the growth in your professional responsibilities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is vital to understanding your fit for both the company, as well as the position that you are applying - to something that a functional resume does not help with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, recruiters are used to scanning particular sections of a resume based on their experience, and a completely different resume format could leave them stumped and they may or may not focus on the relevant parts of the resume, or even confine it to the rejection pile. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the alternative?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you must be wondering if you belong to any of the three scenarios presented above what should you do? The answer is simple - you prescribe to a hybrid resume format which combines the best of both worlds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are currently the industry standard as they provide:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The relevant skills that you possess</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A snapshot of your entire profile based on a very comprehensive but crisp professional summary, and </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your work ex in the reverse chronological order showing your career trajectory from start to present</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://makemyresume.co.in/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MakeMyResume</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is among many of the world's leading professional resume writing services that subscribes to this template, unless a Visual or International resume format is required.</span></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR - </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An F format resume is a resume template based on the fallacious interpretation of a study by the Nielsen Norman group which stated that people tend to read web content in an ‘F’ pattern, i.e. the first few words of every sentence and the first few lines of every page garner the maximum attention and the rest would not, resulting in an F-pattern. In this template professional skills are listed as headers instead of the organisation you worked for and your tenure in them, and your responsibilities are grouped accordingly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to various reasons including the failure to track your career trajectory, recruiters despise this format and it is strictly recommended to not use it unless specifically asked to. What you can do instead Is adhere to a hybrid resume format which companies like MakeMyResume use.</span></p>",

Put in the </span><strong>actual job title</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Don’t write self-employed, freelancer, etc. These titles are vague, generic &amp; nondescript, and have a slight negative bias attached to them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the two examples below, which seems more appropriate for a content role?</span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/59/gallery/image1.png\" data-size=\"791x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/59/gallery/image1-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"994\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/59/gallery/image2.png\" data-size=\"800x1035\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/59/gallery/image2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"994\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The former, right?

Whether it is content writer, copywriter, content creator, social media management, or some allied field, if you’ve done that work, you can tweak the title - you’re the only verifiable source. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add words like contract, freelancer, consultant, etc. </span><strong>at the end</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to denote the capacity in which you worked, rather than the phrase ‘self-employed’.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should you provide in the work experience?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, structure it like any other stint where you were employed - that is to say mention all the tasks you performed, any key highlights or accomplishments&lt;link to ‘How do you write an impact on a resume?’&gt;, </span><a href=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/resume-writing-tips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your skills and projects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a simple checklist to follow, chronologically:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Job title </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- The same as the role you’re applying to, IF APPLICABLE; otherwise, go for the nearest applicable one.

Just avoid using that term and use the actual job/work title with alternatives like contract, freelancer and consultant in the end. Structure the rest like you would a salaried position. Ensure to provide quantifiable information and achievements, and customize it to make it relevant to positions you;re applying to.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You were probably in the midst of drafting your resume and suddenly realized you wanted to figure out how to mention a major professional accomplishment, right? Well, it’s good that you did! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than your general roles and responsibilities, it’s the impact you’ve created that recruiters want to know - it separates you from a run-of-the-mill employee and provides a glimpse of your true capabilities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, it is vital to include any major impact/accomplishments you’ve had during your work experience.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use the PAR framework</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how exactly do you showcase your professional achievements? Simple - use the </span><a href=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/resume-accomplishments/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAR framework</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - a simple tool we designed at </span><a href=\"https://makemyresume.co.in/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MakeMyResume</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to effectively demonstrate professional impact on the customer’s resume.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PAR framework consists of 3 chronological elements, that answer the 3 main questions - Why, How &amp; What:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Problem </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- The WHY; the issue or area of improvement you solved/worked on</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Action </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- The HOW; the corrective steps you took or the tasks you did to bring about the impact</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Result </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- The WHAT; explaining the outcome of your efforts </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Problem’ section essentially contains the reason that spurred you to take action. It could be anything. Let’s take 2 examples:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something simple such as wanting to improve average customer satisfaction scores</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something complex like overly long processes resulting in operational inefficiency </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Action’ section focuses on the efforts undertaken to solve the problems. In the case of the two examples, it could be:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding a single line in a customer service trainee manual by asking customer care executives to start with a question as to whether the person they were speaking to had time to talk</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removing redundant processes, upskilling employees to use the latest tools &amp; automating simple, but time-consuming processes</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘Result’ section outlines the effect your actions had on the problem - how it mitigated it or resulted in an improvement. For our two examples, it could be on the lines of</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved CSAT scores to 93% from 69%</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased operational efficiency by 57% by consolidating various feedback &amp; quality check rounds into a single structured meeting and automating data entry</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, the final output for these two examples would be something like this:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refined the customer service manual by making vital changes in the script, thereby improving CSAT scores to 93% from 79%</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduced process time and increased operational efficiency by 57% by consolidating various feedback &amp; quality check rounds into a single structured meeting and automating data entry </span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Points to keep in mind</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might have noticed a few similarities in the final outputs above, intended to maximize the influence your impact has on the recruiter. These are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quantify your statement - it provides credibility to your point. If you don’t have the numbers on hand, calculate them.

Happy (job) hunting!</span></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR - </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use the PAR framework to make your achievements impactful. Underline the problem, highlight the actions taken &amp; demonstrate the result. Ensure that the resulting sentence contains quantifiable information and is no longer than a single sentence that is three lines long. Preferably include these points in a separate bucket under the same work experience!</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a doubt, the Professional Summary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The professional summary is a holistic but concise snapshot of </span><strong>your profile</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, comprising three main aspects:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Your experience (and outstanding achievements)</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - Refers to the domain, sector, organization, roles, etc. you’ve worked in/managed, as well as any extraordinary accomplishments within them, if applicable.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Your skills </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Refers to the skills you possess and have developed over the course of your professional experience to excel at your workplace. Includes both soft and hard skills.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Your USP</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - Refers to your key strengths, including your professional areas of expertise. You can also include extracurriculars such as volunteering, or developed non-professional skills such as stand-up, music, etc.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind, all of these (barring extracurriculars, should you choose to mention them) need to be geared towards the role you’re applying to - the summary is meant to portray you as the ideal candidate for </span><strong>that role</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not the ideal worker in general. Thus, relevancy is the key aspect to remember while drafting any resume.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It requires the ability to identify cross-functional skills that can be applied to or are common across even drastically different domains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, let’s say you’ve worked for a few months as a software engineer and want to switch to Marketing. They’re two widely different profiles - however, many skills (especially soft skills) overlap. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As both a software engineer and a marketing executive, you need to excel at understanding client requirements to deliver a product (be it an app or a campaign) to ensure utility and client satisfaction. Thus, interfacing with a client and understanding their requirements is a simple and basic, but vital skill applied to both domains</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a software engineer, let’s also assume that you were able to identify additional applications of your app in a completely different segment. This demonstrates the ability to identify new channels for generating revenue - a crucial skill for a marketer as well!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re often asked by our customers if they have a chance at landing an interview when applying for a job in a completely different domain. Clearly, the answer is a resounding YES! It’s vital to identify HOW to market yourself and your skills in a way that the recruiter is able to firmly establish a pertinent link between the role and your profile, without resorting to blatant lies.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is the Professional Summary the most important part of the resume?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Professional Summary is chronologically the first section of your resume containing details applicable to the role you’re applying for, and thus the first thing a recruiters’ eyes will fall on and scan through intently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its primary purpose is to ensure that the reader finds your profile relevant enough to the position applied to, to bother scanning the rest of your resume. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, if your summary isn’t strong or relevant enough, your application will join the other rejects on the discard pile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from relevance, it also requires powerful content. No matter how relevant your profile, </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2018/07/11/when-hiring-executives-top-recruiters-look-for-these-important-traits/?sh=57b5619d68a2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recruiters are also looking for leaders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They’re (more often than not) employing you for the long-term, and want to ensure you have the ability to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accordingly, your resume must reflect this ability with the usage of action verbs, leadership skills, and quantified information, along with any exceptional accomplishments (awards, honours, statistics, etc.) to lend weight and credence to your application.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do we write a resume summary?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To craft an effective and powerful professional summary, you must focus on 3 aspects:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Length</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - Your summary in its entirety should be a minimum of 3 points, and should not exceed 5 sentences/points. Additionally, each point should not be more than 3 lines long! This ensures that they read through the whole point rather than finding it too tedious to peruse.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Language </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- Ensure that the summary is written using </span><a href=\"https://talent.works/2018/01/08/the-science-of-the-job-search-part-i-13-data-backed-ways-to-win/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">powerful action verbs and include leadership words</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for a massive boost in hireability of up to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">140%</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It (obviously) needs to be free of any grammatical errors as well.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Content</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - Quantified information is indispensable - it lends credibility and demonstrates the calculable impact that you’ve created.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understandably, considering the sheer details, technicality and scope just a single section of a resume contains can be overwhelming, especially if you’re creating your resume from scratch. This is where professional resume writing services come through to ensure that no step or technicality is missed out, and our guide&lt;link to “Should I pay someone to write my resume?”&gt; can help you identify the best services out there for the same!</span></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - The most important part of a resume is the professional (or resume) summary. It serves as a snapshot of your profile, and essentially functions as your USP - only if your summary is powerful and relevant will recruiters read the rest of your resume. To ensure the same, it should be 3-5 points (no more than 3 lines each), should include action verbs &amp; leadership words, and quantified content. It must contain the relevant experience, skills, achievements and strengths you possess.</span></p>",

Depending on whether you’re a fresher or newbie in the industry (upto 5 years of work experience), an industry veteran (5-10 years of work experience) or a leader (11+ years of work experience), your resume will range from 1 page to 3 pages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a fresher/newbie, the ideal length is 1 full page. It must neither fall short of nor exceed this limit.

This is enough to capture the skills and work experience you’ve managed to obtain, without ending up too wordy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, for an extremely senior/leadership role, the widely-recognized upper limit for a resume is 3 pages, meant to provide enough space to detail your most valuable accomplishments and relatively recent work experience - <a href=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/how-far-back-should-a-resume-go/\">your resume should not go too far back</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/number-pages-resume/\">Our detailed guide</a> explains the reasons for these limits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The back-end of this limit is attributed to the amount of time recruiters spend on reading your resume, ranging from 6-30 seconds during the initial filtering processes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The longer your resume, the more tedious it feels to read and the lesser time and attention you get per page - the recruiters could end up missing out on key information which could have landed you that interview!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, unless you belong to the criteria of:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not being experienced enough, or </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Belonging to offbeat sectors like teaching, science, etc., </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always ensure your resume is 2 pages long!</span></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR - </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2-page resume is the ideal length for a resume, especially if you have more than 4-5 years of experience.

When you take into account that the average time spent perusing a resume maxes out at </span><a href=\"https://jobs.theguardian.com/article/does-your-cv-pass-the-30-second-speed-test-/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 seconds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it effectively means recruiters read a maximum of roughly 125-150 words of your resume during initial screenings; it also means that 125-150 words are all you have to impress them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, they scan </span><a href=\"https://www.ere.net/why-you-cant-get-a-job-recruiting-explained-by-the-numbers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 main categories</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Job titles</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies you worked at</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start/end dates </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, deep-diving into any other sections is redundant. It seems the less is more adage applies to resumes too - as long as you don’t miss out on the important and relevant info.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are there any exceptions to this rule?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you’re an academic or industrial scientist, college professor, school teacher, or social service worker you’re probably wondering how you could possibly fit all your work and/or publications within such a short resume. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fear not, this rule doesn’t apply to you! In fact, in these professions a longer resume is a sign of success - the more patents, research papers, charitable drives, etc. you have done, the better, and each needs to be documented for appraisal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>TL;DR</strong> - The ideal resume is up to two to three pages long. The length is determined by your experience level - for those with 0-5 years work ex, 1 page is enough. For those with 6-10 years of work ex, a two-pager suffices. Only those with work ex of 10+ years should go for a three-pager. However, if you’re in the science, education or social service sectors, the longer your resume, the better.</span></p>",
