They are of different types and formats, each catering to specific needs of the candidates. In this post, we are going to discuss two types of formats - namely, professional and visual resume.</p><h2>Professional Resume:</h2><p>Professional resumes represent the commonly used format used in today's corporate world. It represents a <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-create-a-professional-resume-2063237">polished format</a>, allowing ease of reading and being specific to the job being applied for. Recruiters spend less than 30 seconds while reading through a resume. And hence, an improperly formatted one, riddled with typing errors, excessive jargon, and unrelated information is damming for a candidate. While professional resumes make for a good representation of the candidate's credentials and experience, they also have their shortcomings.</p><h3>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Tried and tested format</li><li>Good use of space</li></ul><h3>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Dull and not visually appealing</li><li>Redundant</li></ul><h2>Visual Resume:</h2><blockquote><em>"The internet has changed the way we communicate with each other, the way we learn about the world and the way we conduct</em> <em>business" -</em> <strong>Ron Wyden</strong><em> </em></blockquote><p>In this age of social media, communication and interactions have become more visual than ever before. And this has also <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-digital-tools-that-will-make-your-resume-infinitely-more-beautiful">changed the way resumes are written</a>. Using a visual resume to map out the educational background, work experience, and skill set in a crisp and aesthetically pleasing way has now become an appealing way for applicants to catch the attention of potential employers when applying for a job.</p><h3>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Visually appealing</li><li>Differentiates from crowd</li></ul><h3>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Risky as recruiters may or may not like it</li><li>Not the most standard use of the format</li><li>Usage of space is poor</li></ul><p>Different formats thus have their own pros and cons. Recruiters and candidates alike prefer professional resumes. But they have become dull and commonplace from being used by almost every other candidate <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2017/02/resume-preparedness-for-interviews/">applying for a job</a>. And as such, visual resumes have become a breath of fresh air, providing a dynamic and aesthetic look to the overall resume. But all that depends on the applicant and the specifications of the job being applied for.</p><p><em>Image Credit: Freepik</em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 27, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fguide.makemyresume.co.in%2Fdifference-professional-visual-resume%2F&amp;title=Difference%20between%20Professional%20Resume%20and%20Visual%20Resume" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Difference%20between%20Professional%20Resume%20and%20Visual%20Resume https%3A%2F%2Fguide.makemyresume.co.in%2Fdifference-professional-visual-resume%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/thank-you-letters-job-interviews/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Thank you letters and Job Interviews</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/work-life-balance/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Work-Life Balance - A fantasy in a real world? </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-06-11T16:17" class="feed__date">June 11, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/resume-writing-tips/" class="invert">Resume-Writing Tips: Not Just Any Piece of Paper</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-08-09T11:32" class="feed__date">August 9, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/infographic-need-great-resume/" class="invert">INFOGRAPHIC: Here&amp;#039;s Why You need a Great Resume</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-03-27T11:10" class="feed__date">March 27, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/internship-application-resume/" class="invert">Internship Application - Get Interview Calls with your Resume</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2021 Quantum Careers Tech Pvt Ltd</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
