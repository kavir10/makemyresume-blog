Hold your breath - there is always a way to work things out.</p><p>The first week at a new office, surrounded by new people can be stressful – but take this in your stride. You are about to make a significant beginning at the start of your career. The first week at any organisation for an employee is mostly to get familiar with the surrounding, and oriented to the work assigned to each employee – termed as an induction/training period at most organisations. However, if you just stick to these basics – you are not making your first week productive at all.</p><blockquote>"Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow."</blockquote><h3>Know the Organisation</h3><p>I am sure you must have gone through the company website before giving your interview. Now you are an employee, just knowing information about the company through the website is not enough. If you find yourself sitting idle for too long – go around and look for the organisation manual. Read the mission, vision, and values that your organisation stands for. Know the major accomplishments and milestones of your organisation. Go through their HR policies – so you don’t experience a panic attack later. Last but not the least – get to know the hierarchy of your organisation, so you’re already <a href="http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/03/goal-setting-stepping-stone-success/">setting goals</a>, to make your way to the top of the ladder.</p><h3>Ask Questions</h3><p>Be inquisitive in the right way – ask questions. Don’t hesitate to ask any question. Your first week is where you will receive answers from anyone you ask questions to. The number of questions you ask is directly proportional to your level of learning acquired. Ask questions about the work you need to perform.</p><p>There’s a possibility that you’d be given tons of data to analyse, or excel sheets to make – don’t be mechanical and work like a robot. Your organisation didn’t need a robot, they needed a human to add more value to the organisation. Sharpen your cognitive abilities by asking meaningful questions and go home feeling knowledgeable. Unlike your friends, you can actually have a productive answer to ‘How was your first week at work?’</p><h3>Maximize your interactions</h3><p>You are bound to go into a shell, with the shock of being among unfamiliar people. However, there is a trick to follow – the interactions you make in the first week – will take you places. In the following weeks, when you have major responsibilities to tackle, you already know how to work your way around with people.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.economist.com/node/12510632"><em>Hawthorne effect</em></a> named after Frederick Taylor's influential ideas, focused on an individual in a social context, established that the performance of employees are influenced by their surroundings and by the people that they are working with as much as by their own innate abilities.</p><p>There is no better way than your first week to maximize your interactions with your colleagues. Feel gutsy enough to strike a conversation with your Senior Managers, Managers, or the Vice President. If you get a chance to attend a social gathering at work – mingle around and get familiar. Networking is an important skill in an individual’s career life, and the earlier you start – the better you get. This will help build your confidence at a faster pace and reflect in your performance at work too.</p><h3>Be Proactive</h3><p>In the first week at work, you’re judged on various parameters. One of them is your enthusiasm level. How proactive are you in taking up projects? Do you look at the excel sheet as just another burden to your pile of work stacked at your desk? Don’t be lethargic to take on any assignment that comes your way. If you find yourself sitting idle, ask around for work. Your outlook towards taking up challenges at work can help you improve work productivity largely.</p><p>A <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/happy-productivity-work/">new study</a> says it has concrete evidence that happier employees are more productive in the workplace. The <em>Social Market Foundation</em> and the University of Warwick’s <em>Center for Competitive Advantage</em> in the Global Economy, in Britain conducted an experiment on 700 employees. Greater your level of proactivity, the happier you are in the workplace – and thus you are able to make significant contributions at work.</p><h3>Set up your Workstation</h3><p>You are definitely assigned a desk at your workplace, which is most likely your permanent seating place. Don’t be surprised if your desk isn’t organised – there could be files lying around, stationary scattered, and your computer just set up somewhere in the middle. Organise your workstation. Set aside files and papers stacked neatly, so when you work – you know exactly where to go and fetch for things. Keep aside handy stuff like post-its to help you set reminders and make a to-do-list of things you need to attend to on priority.</p><p>Check for your drawers, tidy up papers and dispose of the junk files in a storeroom. It is essential to set up your workstation in your first week since once your kick off with work in full swing – you don’t have time to spend on petty stuff like tiding up your workstation. In addition, an organised workstation will help you work efficiently without any interruptions.</p><p>Make the best of your first week at work to extract maximum results that will reflect eventually in the later week. The more you grasp, the greater you learn – so don’t miss any opportunity at learning.</p><blockquote>"Productivity is less about what you do with your time, and more about how you run your mind."</blockquote><p><em>Image: <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/business-plan-monitor-wall-3219705/">Pixabay</a></em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 26, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fmake-your-first-week-at-work-and039productiveand039%2F&amp;title=Make%20your%20first%20week%20at%20work%20%26%23039%3BProductive%26%23039%3B" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Make%20your%20first%20week%20at%20work%20%26%23039%3BProductive%26%23039%3B https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fmake-your-first-week-at-work-and039productiveand039%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/goal-setting-your-stepping-stone-to-success/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Goal Setting - Your Stepping Stone to Success</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/first-time-manager-here-are-5-things-to-follow/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> First-Time Manager?
