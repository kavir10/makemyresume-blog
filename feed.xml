                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many pages is a resume?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resume should be two to three pages long, generally. While there are exceptions to this rule, it is widely recognized that they should never exceed this limit unless specifically asked to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the length of a resume is primarily dictated by the level of experience you possess, which can be categorized into 3 major brackets:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>0-5 years of experience - 1 page resume</strong><strong><br></strong></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>6-10 years of experience - 2 page resume</strong><strong><br></strong></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>11+ years of experience - 2/3 page resume</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>0-5 years of experience - 1 page resume</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a fresher or entry-level executive, you have neither a wealth of experience nor a long list of skills and professional achievements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extracurricular achievements and side projects, which make up the bulk of your resume, serve as differentiators at best; hence, they need not be listed in detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only as you approach 4-5 years of experience does your resume warrant even the thought of expanding to more than a page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That too if you’ve managed to handle multiple roles within the organization(s) and had an extraordinary amount of work and responsibility handed over to you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<h3><strong>6-10 years of experience - 2 page resume</strong><strong><br></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an increase in seniority, your resume can extend to upto 2 pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you would’ve gained plenty of work experience and managed several roles and responsibilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since these will be relatively fresh and recent, they can be explicated in detail to provide a better understanding of the variety of skills you have developed and knowledge you have obtained after working in your domain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you belong to this category, you can apply to senior technical and entry- or mid-managerial positions, both of which require a diverse set of competencies, and your resume needs to be detailed enough to reflect that!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<h3><strong>11+ years of experience - 2/3 page resume</strong><strong><br></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you fall under this bracket, you’re officially a veteran of the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The myriad roles and responsibilities you’ve managed need a resume that’s a minimum of 2 pages, and could easily exceed it too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To effectively demonstrate your extensive professional expertise and wide repertoire of technical, managerial and interpersonal skills, a 2-pager is a must. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have 15-20+ years of experience, and are aiming for a very senior or CXO-level position, a three-pager would be recommended as your resume will undergo extensive screening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiters will try to gauge not just your fit for the role, but the company as a whole too! Keep in mind, however, the fact that your <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/how-far-back-should-a-resume-go/">resume should not go back more than 15-20 years</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is resume length restricted?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no hard-and-fast rule that one cannot have a 5 or even 10 page resume; these restrictions are essentially tips based on research that has been proven several times - crisp resumes upto 3 pages long have the highest chance of being selected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><a href="https://talent.works/2018/12/05/the-science-of-the-job-search-part-viii-your-chances-of-an-interview-plummet-if-your-resume-is-too-long/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> analyzed 6000+ applications to identify the sweet spot for the word count - resumes ranging from 475 to 600 words had the highest chances of landing an interview. In certain fields such as in business, they found that long resumes (exceeding 600 words) were </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">72%</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less hireable than those in the sweet spot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, a </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettnelson/2012/06/04/do-you-read-fast-enough-to-be-successful/?sh=64a20e18462e" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quick glance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals that “successful” adults read at 250-300 words per minute. When you take into account that the average time spent perusing a resume maxes out at </span><a href="https://jobs.theguardian.com/article/does-your-cv-pass-the-30-second-speed-test-/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 seconds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it effectively means recruiters read a maximum of roughly 125-150 words of your resume during initial screenings; it also means that 125-150 words are all you have to impress them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, they scan </span><a href="https://www.ere.net/why-you-cant-get-a-job-recruiting-explained-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 main categories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job titles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies you worked at</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start/end dates </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, deep-diving into any other sections is redundant. It seems the less is more adage applies to resumes too - as long as you don’t miss out on the important and relevant info.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there any exceptions to this rule?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you’re an academic or industrial scientist, college professor, school teacher, or social service worker you’re probably wondering how you could possibly fit all your work and/or publications within such a short resume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear not, this rule doesn’t apply to you! In fact, in these professions a longer resume is a sign of success - the more patents, research papers, charitable drives, etc. you have done, the better, and each needs to be documented for appraisal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>TL;DR</strong> - The ideal resume is up to two to three pages long. The length is determined by your experience level - for those with 0-5 years work ex, 1 page is enough. For those with 6-10 years of work ex, a two-pager suffices. Only those with work ex of 10+ years should go for a three-pager. However, if you’re in the science, education or social service sectors, the longer your resume, the better.</span></p>

                    <img src="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/54/photo-1506784365847-bbad939e93351" alt="How far back should a resume go" />
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your resume should go back 15 to 20 years, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at most</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why just 15-20 years?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It boils down to three major reasons:</span></p>
<h3>Hireability</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://talent.works/2018/01/08/the-science-of-the-job-search-part-i-13-data-backed-ways-to-win/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentWorks’ research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your hireability drops by 8% annually after you cross the age of 35. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiters guess your age using your graduation details, and your hireability in their eyes could fall if you’re above the ‘age limit’.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Resume Length</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an industry veteran with a wealth of experience, expounding upon it, especially older stints and achievements, can prove detrimental. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your resume could easily exceed 3 pages, the (widely recognized) upper limit for resume length. Unless you’re an academic, scientist or teacher/professor, resumes longer than 3 pages reduce your chances of getting an interview.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Relevancy</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The further back your resume goes, the less relevant it becomes to the role you’re applying to. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill sets, expertise, technical functions &amp; duties differ so significantly that what you’ve learned and executed back then would have little to no impact on your profile and knowledge base today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a short, crisp and relevant resume trumps an excessively lengthy one any day of the week!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could you explain further?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiters want young blood in their organizations for fresher perspectives and contemporary knowledge of industry trends &amp; skill sets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let’s say you’re 40, and graduated 20 years back. After 10 years of work ex, you decided to change your field, and are now applying for a very senior position at a unicorn. Since it is 2021 now, your resume mentions your graduation date as 2001. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using this, they can infer that you’re roughly in the 38-43 bracket (considering the length of courses, early/late schooling, etc.), and your chances of being hired compared to say a 30ish-year-old who graduated in 2011, fall automatically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if your resume is restricted to your work experience of the last 15 years, they cannot accurately guess your age as being 35+ (though to be honest, it’s an easy calculation, but then they do not spend that much time during the first few rounds of resume filtering).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://jobs.theguardian.com/article/does-your-cv-pass-the-30-second-speed-test-/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiters spend roughly 6-30 seconds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scanning your resume during the initial resume screening processes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longer your content, the lesser time they spend per page - do you really want them to miss out on important content because your resume was too long? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your resume to a manageable 2 pages (3 at most, if you’re applying for a CXO-level position) ensures it’s packed with information &amp; important details while excluding irrelevant and unimportant snippets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step into the shoes of a recruiter that is hiring someone for a senior management position at an MNC. It requires leadership, foresight, vast knowledge of macro &amp; micro trends in the industry, excellent people-management &amp; negotiation skills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would the kind of work a potential candidate did at an intern- or entry-level position 25 years back have the slightest importance or relevancy in terms of the knowledge or experience required for the position? Obviously not! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, either completely eliminating or only very briefly mentioning these is the preferred practice and norm, especially since it helps in reducing the length of your resume and even gives you more space to highlight recent and more relevant experience and achievements which could go a long way towards getting you that interview.</span></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your resume should go back no more than 15-20 years from the time of applying to a role. It helps the resume be of a manageable length, reduces the chance of an age bias working against you, and provides a much more relevant and informative resume!</span></p>

Not every Job Search process will lead you the right kind of job. However, if you have taken enough time to plan the process out, you are surely headed the right way.

<p>Just follow the simple steps to a Definite Action Plan for your Job Search</p>
<h2>Know your strengths and weaknesses</h2>
<p>This point is crucial, not just before planning a job search, but also until you land an interview with any organization. One must be able to identify their strengths and weaknesses at the earlier stage. If your strength lies in excellent communication - you know you'd easily fit into roles like PR, Sales, Trainer. Moreover, identifying your weaknesses before a job search can buy you enough time to build on those weaknesses and convert them into strengths.</p>
<h2>Start your initial search</h2>
<p>What exactly would an initial search include? Do you know how to look up jobs on a job portal? Are you well informed about the various jobs that exist on job portals? Are you aware of the right keywords you can use to get the right jobs? One needs to be thorough with the initial homework. An initial homework would include the use of the right keywords, knowledge of the various job portals along with the job postings.</p>
<p>Moreover, have you studied the market well for the field you've chosen? Do you know the designation that exists for the type of job you're seeking? Hence, an initial search is crucial. It's a virtual peek into the market. Also, it is done to get you familiarised with the type of jobs that exist in the market. Moreover, you get introduced to job descriptions, which state the roles and responsibilities of the candidate an employer is seeking. Don't mess up your initial search, take time out and do it well!</p>
<h2>Revamp your resume</h2>
<p>Your resume is your ticket to land a good job. It's simple, if the details on your ticket aren't precise and accurate, you don't get past the boarding gate.  Similarly, your resume needs to state every detail precisely. Do you still hold an outdated resume? Well, then it's time you revamp it.</p>
<p>If you still think, you can fake a few details on your resume to put up an impressive document - you're wrong. Every detail put on your resume must hold evidence. Update your recent <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/resume-certifications/">certifications</a>, <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-education/">educational qualifications</a>, <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/volunteer-experience-resume/">volunteer experience</a>, and your previous <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/">work experience</a>. Make sure your resume looks fresh.</p>
<h2>Create a target list of companies</h2>
<p>We all have that dream list of companies we want to work for. Now is the time you start carving your dream to reality. If you have envisioned working for a particular company, now is the time to make your dreams more realistic. Create a list of companies and make a target list. Put Google to the best use and research about those companies. This extends your knowledge concerning the organization you're targeting, and when you land an interview with the same organization - you're best placed to answer any questions the interviewer throws at you regarding the organization.</p>
<p>Don't let the interviewer have an impression that you haven't done your homework well. Knowing about the organization you wish to work for will always give you an edge over the other applicants.</p>
<h2>Create your online presence (LinkedIn)</h2>
<p>What does a platform like LinkedIn do? Do you think it enhances your job search? Well, LinkedIn is one of the most widely known platforms to explore your job opportunities. LinkedIn connects you to different employers around the globe, where you have the opportunity to explore your choices. If you intend to get noticed by the well-known employers on LinkedIn, it is really important to create an online presence before you venture into the application process.</p>
<p>Take time out and build your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn provides you with various sections, where the right amount of information can get you to the right employer. Increase your reach, so when recruiters look up your profile, they aren't spending time browsing - Your profile is out there among the top searches! LinkedIn also provides you with a section to look out for jobs. All you do is enter your preferred designation, for eg: Manager with your preferred location. Do you see how creating an online presence can multiply your chances of getting closer to your dream job?</p>
<h2><strong>Network online</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot stress their enough - CONTACTS MATTER. By networking with like-minded individuals, especially if they belong to the same domain, you can demonstrate your capability and competency. Thus, should a vacancy arise in their organization, your network contacts could notify you of the same, and if thoroughly impressed with what they’ve seen of you, potentially even vouch for you, helping you land a more senior role at a better organization. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/power-your-professional-vouch-ronnie-battista/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains the power of a professional ‘vouch’ and the impact it can have on your job prospects!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various ways and forums you can network professionally, LinkedIn being foremost. To a smaller extent, Facebook and Twitter too can be used for the same. You can even network via popular community forums like Reddit, Pinterest, Quora, etc. Engaging with &amp; producing content of your own via blogs, podcasts, articles, etc. too helps!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Strengthen your Profile</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiters today look for more than just academic or professional achievements - they want productive individuals that contribute not just to the organization, but to the society at large too. Employees function as the organizations’ ambassadors, and they want to ensure they’ve got the creme de la creme. Furthermore, they’re interested in hiring candidates that demonstrate a desire to learn and update themselves constantly. It also helps if you have personal extracurricular achievements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal candidate, thus, would be one with impressive academic (mainly if you’re a fresher) and/or professional achievements, with a few courses and tools under their belt used in the domain they’re applying to, who also actively pursues their hobbies and volunteers at the local NGO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take 2 candidates, A &amp; B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A has 1 year of experience in Social Media Marketing, possesses know-how regarding various tools like Buffer, Quuu &amp; Canva, and recently did a course on Content Strategy from Coursera. A table tennis champ at the local club, they're a member of Sunday Friends and actively participates in at least 1 drive per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B has 1 years’ experience in Social Media Marketing, and while their numbers seem as good as A’s, they has done no supplementary courses and they're  only heard of Canva &amp; Buffer, never used them. They've never even heard of Quuu. He spends most of their free time with friends at the local bar playing pool, or binging OTT content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite B being just as competent as A, their profile reflects no upskilling. their knowledge and skillset will become outdated and obsolete soon. Conversely, A is constantly updating their skillset and knowledge base and demonstrated a drive to learn more. They've also contributed to their neighbourhood and people have a high opinion of them. Even though B has not spent their time nefariously, it offers the company no benefit as opposed to having A allied with them - A could contribute to their CSR activities, with the added benefit of having a conscientious individual linked to their brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really want that job you’ve dreamed of? Be like A.</span></p>

<p>In today’s time, most interviews are Zoom interviews. Companies do this for multiple reasons: the organization has its head office located in another country or another city. Sometimes, due to the candidate unavailability and the urgency to fill in the position, employers immediately conduct a Zoom job interview.</p>

<p>People form first impressions when you meet them in person. However, first impressions can be made rapidly through a Zoom job interview as well. Just to make sure, you are giving your best at the Zoom job interview, follow these quick tips:</p>
<h3>#1 Make sure you have an uninterrupted internet connectivity</h3>
<p>The first thing to do before the Zoom call is to check on your internet connectivity. You require a seamless internet connection. An interrupted Zoom interview can have a negative effect and break the link of the interview discussion. So make sure, your internet is connected well and is functioning at a good speed. Use Wi-fi connection instead of the mobile data, since the mobile data often gets interrupted.</p>
<h3>#2 Appropriately position your laptop or phone</h3>
<p>Remember, the Zoom job interview isn’t any casual video call with your friend. Thus, it is important to know that you need to set your mobile phone on a stable surface where you are visibly clear. Avoid holding your phone in your hand, since you will end up moving it multiple times and it comes across as highly unprofessional.</p>
<h3>#3 Use of wired/ wireless headphones</h3>
<p>During a Zoom job interview, don’t rely on the microphone to communicate. Any possible disruption of the voice and the background sounds can lead to disturbances during the ongoing interview. Get your headphones ready in advance before scheduling the Zoom job interview.</p>
<h3>#4 Non-Verbal Cues and Body Language</h3>
<p>A Zoom job interview is nearly similar to a personal interview. Your interviewer can easily capture your body language and <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2017/10/decoding-non-verbal-cues-interview/">non-verbal cues</a> through the video. Sit upright, and dress in formal attire. Make sure you are not walking around any corridor during the interview. Treat this as important as equal to a personal interview.</p>
<h3>#5 Prepare and Request Feedback</h3>
<p>Prepare well in advance and take a test call a day in advance with a friend. Make all the necessary preparations concerning the equipment as well as to the questions you are likely to counter at the actual interview. You will receive a glimpse of the actual interview. Once you're done with the interview, request feedback from your friend and appropriately make improvements.</p>

<p>Salary negotiations are one of the most difficult barriers to pass at the time of signing an offer with any organization. Think you’re offered too less? Will you come across as greedy, if you’re asking for a higher salary? How do you prove to the person across the table about your capabilities? Too many thoughts to battle against before actually getting to the negotiation. You have simple 5 negotiation tips to follow that could ease this process.</p>

<h3>Understand benchmarking</h3>
<p>Your time is valuable and you don’t want to waste it on an organization that isn’t offering what you are worth. This requires you to understand how employees understand their salary levels and thus adjust your job search.</p>
<p>At the same time, Companies use various benchmarking tools. They compare average pay rates with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay at other companies in their industry</li>
<li>The salary for professionals with your level of education and experience</li>
<li>The income of professionals in your field in their area of the country</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers interested in you will offer you the best salary after weighing your competencies. However, understand the benchmarking process and make the right negotiation.</p>
<h3>Shift focus from past pay to future potential</h3>
<p>Your future pay package is usually always given in reference to your past pay. When you are at the table talking about your offer – the concerned HR person will give you a hike based on your previous salary. This is a normal process and most organizations follow this. Regardless, there are tactics you can use to have the hiring manager focus on what you can do now and in the future. Take his mind out of the past and let him know your goals and aspirations on the new job.</p>
<h3>Understand their constraints</h3>
<p>The organization may like you. They also think you deserve everything. However, when you look at the salary break-up – these intentions are not visible there. Why? You have to understand that every organization sets a budget for an employee. They have constraints and salary caps that no negotiations can break. In such a circumstance, your job is solely to figure out whether they are flexible or not. During a bulk selection, for e.g. Any organization taking in 20 people at the same time, your salary can’t be higher than the other. However, you would have noticed that your organization has been generous and flexible at the start dates, vacations, bonuses and additional incentives.</p>
<p>It’s better you understand the organization’s constraints before you put forth your proposal. Don’t make any decision without gauging all the problems.</p>
<h3>Everything counts</h3>
<p>Remember when you are calculating your salary – don’t get too excited on the whole figure. Usually, employees get happy at the whole figure and forget to calculate the components of the salary. Remember to consider the value of benefits like bonuses, commissions, health insurance, flexible spending accounts, profit-sharing, paid vacation, stock benefits. You have to take into account every component and then make a final proposal.</p>
<h3>Don’t get emotional – Get Creative</h3>
<p>Don’t be too focused and emotional about your salary while negotiating. You need to create a certain reputation which doesn’t come across and desperate and greedy. Instead, create a smart image – make the employer feel you have that spark in you, and they are convinced about giving you a higher salary.</p>
<p>Negotiations don’t need to focus only on the salary structure. Instead, try using creative ways and negotiate on the time period, especially if it’s a contract term. Use creative ways and negotiate on getting a contract of a year instead of 6 months. This can also change the perspective of the employer, and you may just notice your salary get better.</p>
<p>Remember, the more a company wants you, the more salary negotiation leverage you have.</p>

And with that come several perks, in addition to providing a boost to your career. In the words of Simon Mainwaring –</p>
<blockquote>“<em>The simple act of saying<strong> ‘thank you’</strong> is a demonstration of gratitude in response to an experience that was meaningful to a customer of citizen.”</em></blockquote>
<p>And going by that, it can be said that <strong>thank you letters</strong> can definitely help you cement a good relationship with clients, vendors or even in getting an eventual job offer. So, let us talk about <strong>thank you letters</strong> - more importantly, how they are of help in job interviews.</p>

<h3>Thank-you letters for job interviews</h3>
<p>One might ask- <em>"How do<strong> thank-you letters</strong> help in case of <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/selling-yourself-effectively-interview/">job interviews</a>?" </em>Well, to answer in a practical way, it is courteous to do that. It is actually important to say thank you to an employer after an interview - it helps to reiterate your views to the employers as to how the job interests you. More importantly, <strong>thank-you letters </strong>help to highlight you in a better light <em>(even if your <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/interview-doand039s-and-donand039ts/">interview did not go according to plan</a>)</em> and entrench your position as the best suitable candidate.</p>
<h3>How to write thank you letters - helpful tips</h3>
<p>Now that we know the importance of <strong>thank you letters</strong>, let's talk about how to write one in the first place.<strong> Thank you letters</strong> should help you thank everyone - from recruiters to everyone who assisted in your job search. Here are some basic points that you should keep in mind while writing <strong>thank you letters</strong> -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowing who to address the thank you letters to</strong></li>
<li><strong>It is all about making an impact and standing out</strong></li>
<li><strong>Take measures to keep it short and simple</strong></li>
<li><strong>Proofread and spellcheck the thank you letter</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lastly, remember to actually write the words <em>"thank you"</em> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Writing <strong>thank you letters</strong> can oftentimes be the key to getting a job offer. In these days of email and online communication, taking the time out to thank your potential employers can <em>(more than anything else)</em> emphasize the fact that you are a well-mannered person. Other than that, it can also reinforce the fact that you want the job. Use your <strong>thank you letter</strong> to address any issues and concerns that came up during the interview. Try to discuss anything of importance that the interviewer might have neglected to ask. And while doing that, restate as to why you want the job, what your qualifications are, how you might be able to contribute positively towards the organisation.</p>
<p>So, the next time you apply for a job - remember to write a <strong>thank you letter</strong>. And as Alfred Painter had once mentioned -</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Saying 'thank you' is more than good manners. It is good spirituality"</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They say that answering all the questions while <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2017/07/selling-yourself-effectively-interview/">effectively selling yourself in the interview</a> can fetch you the job. But little do people know that merely answering the questions is never enough to get you hired. And this applies to Zoom interview as much as in-person interviews.</p>
<p>While it is imperative to articulate properly, an interview comprises of several other aspects as well which can make a world of a difference between pass and fail. And this is where non-verbal cues come into the picture.</p>

<p>They say that answering all the questions while <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2017/07/selling-yourself-effectively-interview/">effectively selling yourself in the interview</a> can fetch you the job. But little do people know that merely answering the questions is never enough to get you hired. And this applies to Zoom interview as much as in-person interviews.</p>
<p>While it is imperative to articulate properly, an interview comprises of several other aspects as well which can make a world of a difference between pass and fail. And this is where non-verbal cues come into the picture.</p>

<p>According to a study conducted by <em>College Journal</em>, <strong>interviews constitute 55% of body language, 7% verbal communication and 38% paralanguage.</strong> These statistics prove that <strong>non-verbal communication is not just essential, but exceptionally vital to ace the process.</strong></p>
<p>Actions speak louder than words. This anthem rings well in the interview scenario too. You tend to make a non-verbal impression right from the moment you enter your interview office. The interviewer makes his first judgment even before you get to say a word.  Hence, it is to the applicant's advantage to grasp the fundamentals of non-verbal cues for ultimate success.</p>
<h5>Non-verbal cues:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Give a glimpse of the emotional state of an applicant</li>
<li>Regulate the flow of communication</li>
<li>Reinforce verbal communication</li>
<li>Define the relationship between the applicant and the interviewer</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes even the most qualified candidates do not make a cut due to their behavior or body language. Such mistakes can ruin your chances of getting the job. Therefore it is imperative to understand the various components of non-verbal communication -</p>
<h2>Body language</h2>
<figure class="alignnone size-large wp-image-298"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/3719.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/3719-xs.jpg 300w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/3719-sm.jpg 480w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/3719-md.jpg 768w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/3719-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/3719-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/3719-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Non-verbal cues" width="700" height="467"></figure>
<p>Body language forms an indispensable part of non-verbal communication as it strengthens an individual's articulation while giving a peek into their attitude and emotions. It constitutes your posture, gestures, head and hand movements and an overall presence of your body.</p>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that your body language communicates more to the other person than what you say or the tone of your voice. For this reason, your body language has a large effect on the recruiter's perceptions of you and hence your likelihood of being hired.</p>
<p>Let us see a few hacks that help you get through this phase like a pro:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrival: </strong>Walk confidently into the interview cabin, greet your hiring manager, make an eye contact, smile and give a confident handshake. This is where you make your first impression.</li>
<li><strong>Posture: </strong>As you take your seat, make sure to sit up straight yet in a relaxed way where your shoulders drop naturally. <em>Do not lean back or fidget as it might make you look lethargic or immature.</em> The goal is to appear confident and enthusiastic.</li>
<li><strong>Angles: </strong>Shoulders should be directed towards the hiring manager to indicate openness.</li>
<li><strong>Leaning: </strong>Don't be a statue or lean-in too aggressively, you might end up invading the interviewer's personal space. Lean in naturally when appropriate but make sure to return to your original sitting position.</li>
<li><strong>Hands and Feet: </strong>Keep your feet flat on the floor and hands in a neutral state unless speaking. Practice a few comfortable poses before the interview which make you look like relaxed and engaged.  Let your hands be in a neutral position unless you're speaking. <em>Never fold your arms in an interview. It substantially reduces your credibility.</em></li>
<li>Keep your gesticulation natural and moderate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Eye Movements</h2>
<figure class="alignnone size-large wp-image-299"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/O5MC2X0.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O5MC2X0-xs.jpg 300w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O5MC2X0-sm.jpg 480w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O5MC2X0-md.jpg 768w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O5MC2X0-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O5MC2X0-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O5MC2X0-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Eye contact" width="700" height="467"></figure>
<p>Eyes never lie. Eye movements act like a sneak-peek into one's soul and are often inclined to reveal information unintentionally. Proper eye contact can make or break your efforts of landing the job. Frequency of eye contact, blink rate, and pupil dilation are all a part of eye movements, which, if paid attention can be of immense help in an interview.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintaining eye contact indicates interest</strong> and is also a major source of feedback. You can always understand the interviewer's interest in you through his frequency of eye contact.</li>
<li>Making eye contact is important. But it is even more important to <strong>avoid over-doing it. </strong>Too much of eye contact is not just bad, it is worse than minimal eye contact.</li>
<li>A well-known trick here is to <strong>look long enough to register the eye color</strong> of the interviewer before looking away.</li>
<li>If you find it difficult to look straight into the eyes of the hiring manager, here's a hack - <strong>draw an imaginary triangle around the other person's eyes and mouth.</strong> Shift your glance every five seconds to different points of this triangle. This way you'll look interested and engrossed in the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain a stable blink rate</strong>. While too much of blinking could mean that you're stressed or are lying, minimal blink rate makes it creepy and forced.</li>
<li>A firm gaze with a steady blink rate cultivates relationships and forms a bridge between listening and speaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Voice Modulation</h2>
<figure class="alignnone size-large wp-image-300"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/O72JJ60.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O72JJ60-xs.jpg 300w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O72JJ60-sm.jpg 480w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O72JJ60-md.jpg 768w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O72JJ60-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O72JJ60-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/media/posts/11/responsive/O72JJ60-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Voice Modulation" width="700" height="467"></figure>
<p>A large part of the impression you make in an interview comes from vocal delivery, not what you say, but how you say that. Your voice delivery can hugely influence your perceived confidence and competence. Voice modulation helps in judging your situational temperament and is an excellent way to communicate your passion for the job.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to keep your speech smooth and warm. The interviewer should find you friendly and approachable.</li>
<li><strong>Try to match up to your interviewer's pace and speaking volume</strong>. Emulating your speaking partner is the most effective way to promote a healthy communication.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to your intonation, rhythm, and pronunciation. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Always be aware of the volume and speed of your message delivery.</strong> Express your ideas in short and simple sentences and pause briefly to let the message sink in.</li>
<li><strong>Never use words like <em>um, er, uh - huh, like, you know</em> etc.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Complete every thought you set out to express.</strong> Expressing complete thoughts indicates confidence in your ideas and the ability to bring them to a conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips to impress</h2>
<p>Admit it! No matter how much ever we discuss non-verbal cues, it is difficult to practice it in real-time. But here are a few hacks to recede your nervousness and put up a great show in your interview :</p>
<h5>Before the interview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Dress appropriately for an interview - wear an outfit that is both formal and contemporary. No bright colors. Plan for it a few days before. Ensure it is well-fitting, cleaned and pressed.</li>
<li>Don't forget the little things - shine your shoes, check for loose hems and make sure your nails are trimmed and clean.</li>
<li>Tone down the bling when it comes to jewelry, makeup and especially fragrance.</li>
<li>Keep your stray hair in check. It is a massive turn-off if a candidate's face is shadowed by tufts of hair.</li>
<li>Ensure that your tattoos and piercings are well hidden.</li>
<li>Bring several copies of <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/resume-writing-tips/">your resume</a> to the interview. You can also bring your work samples and portfolio, if appropriate. But make sure they are all organized professionally.</li>
<li>Learn about the organization. Research about the company through their website and understand their objective behind establishing the company.</li>
</ul>
<h5>During the interview</h5>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your handshake is firm, but not bone-crushing.</li>
<li>Never chew a gum before the hiring panel. It is plain rude and disrespectful.</li>
<li>Do not bring your cell phone, iPod or any other gadgets to the venue.</li>
<li>Listen. Be attentive and pay attention to detail.</li>
<li>Avoid any negative comments. Be positive in narrating your experience.</li>
<li>Do not move your hands wildly while enunciating.</li>
<li>Do not fidget, tap your feet, drum your fingers or keep touching your hands and face incessantly.</li>
<li>Never interrupt the hiring manager.</li>
<li>Never degrade or speak ill of your previous employer. This is extremely important.</li>
<li><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/16-questions-to-ask-at-the-end-of-the-interview/">Prepare some interesting questions to ask the hiring manager.</a></li>
<li>Always thank the interviewer for his time and patience before finishing the interview.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, at the end of the day, an interview is also a conversation. If you prepare right and exude professionalism through your body language, you've already aced that interview!</p>

<p>With increased competitiveness in today’s job market, the onus to “market” oneself has become all the more necessary. And to create such a good first impression, <strong>cover letters</strong> are the most important tool<em> (literally)</em> to have in one’s arsenal.</p>
<p>A <strong>cover letter</strong>, coupled with <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/why-do-you-need-a-great-resume/">a resume</a>, helps to provide additional information about the applicant’s skills and experience.  More specifically, it provides the information that is not mentioned on the resume.</p>

<p>Think of it as trying to sell a product – that product being you. <em>(99% of the applicants write 'hardworking' 'smart'and 'enthusiastic'.</em> Do you really want to sound as generic as that?). </p>
<p><strong>Cover letters</strong> and resumes are often the first information a potential employer receives about an applicant. Knowing about the different types of <strong>cover letters</strong> can thus help you paint a stellar image of your competence, motivation, and experience in front of the potential employers.</p>
<p>It is always advisable to highlight oneself flatteringly in their <strong>cover letters. </strong>And that can either be by basking in reflected glory <em>(such as associations with prestigious institutions) </em>or self-presentation<em> (listing reasons why they are better than others)</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Giacalone/publication/226194840_Impression_management_in_the_resume_and_cover_letter/links/00b49532dc81953f35000000.pdf"><strong>Cover letters</strong> are of three types,</a> each with their individual pros and cons - but that discussion is for another day. Let us, instead talk about cover letters in themselves, and how to write a great one, thereby helping you land a job at your dream company.</p>
<blockquote><em><strong>"Cover letters</strong> should complement, not mirror your resume. Its purpose is to interpret the factual resume and add a personal touch to your application for employment."</em></blockquote>
<h3>Cover letters - What makes for a great cover letter?</h3>
<p><strong>Cover letters</strong> should complement, not mirror your resume. Its purpose is to interpret the factual resume and add a personal touch to your application for employment.</p>
<p><em> Imagine writing a great cover letter, which highlights all of your achievements and skills, but failing to notice the tiniest bit of typing error made in it.</em> <em>How will that present you in the eyes of the employer</em><em>?</em></p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, your application would probably be rejected by them. Always remember that a <strong>cover letter</strong> is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer. They help to create a critical first impression. And so, even the tiniest bit of error casts doubt on your efficiency and attention to details.</p>
<p>Secondly, Imagine writing an error-free <strong>cover letter, </strong>but instead filling it up with generic details. That makes you sound just like the rest in relation to skills and attributes. And employers may find it difficult to select you. That is why it is important to write in such a way that it makes you sound less generic and helps you stand out from the rest of the crowd.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Cover letters help explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization. When written effectively, they lend support in identifying your most relevant skills or experiences. But one thing to keep in mind is to keep the letter focused, concise, and a few paragraphs in length - enough to entice the recruiter to contact you for an<a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/selling-yourself-effectively-interview/"> interview</a>. </p>

<p>Asking smart, well thought out questions at the end of the interview is always a good thing to do. It gives you the opportunity to clear your doubts about the company and the position, and also projects you as genuinely interested in the job.</p>

<p>Before going for the interview, research about the company and prepare a set of questions you would want to get insight about:</p>
<h3>1. Know about the role and the position</h3>
<p>You don’t want to accept a job only to regret later. Ask questions that help you make an educated decision. Some questions that you may want to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you decide to go ahead and hire me, what would a typical work day look like for me?</li>
<li>What personality traits do you think are necessary to succeed in this role?</li>
<li>What challenges am I likely to face during the course of this position?</li>
<li>Who will I be reporting to? Where does the person fall in the hierarchy of the company?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">What has been the career progression of people in this position?</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Understand the beliefs of the company:</h3>
<p>You should see yourself as a good match to the culture, beliefs, and values of the company. Both, you and the company, should be glad to have each other, like a happy couple!</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you define the culture of the company?</li>
<li>What values does the company stand by? How do you ensure they are embedded in day to day activities and long term goals?</li>
<li>How do you resolve conflicts in the company?</li>
<li>Who do you consider your competition? How do you rate yourself against them?</li>
<li>What do you consider as the best part about working for this company?</li>
<li>Do you consider the company to be people oriented or process oriented?</li>
<li>How will the company help me grow?</li>
<li>What constitutes success in the company?</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Be aware of the selection process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any reservations about my qualifications?</li>
<li>Can I provide you with anything else to make your decision simpler?</li>
<li>What are next steps? By when can I expect a decision from your team?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the common parameters that are likely to impact your decision, and the probability of you being successful in the role.</p>
<p>Concerns though, will vary for each individual and you may want to know other aspects to have deeper understanding of what lies ahead.</p>
<h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is imperative to ask questions that will help you make an informed decision about taking up the job</li>
<li>It’s good to voice your concerns and reservations. Don’t feel intimidated</li>
<li>Asking questions also demonstrates your interest in the job and the company</li>
</ul>
