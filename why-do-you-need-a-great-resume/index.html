But they do remember you for standing out of it" - <strong>Eddie Harris</strong></em></blockquote><h2>The essentials for writing a great resume:</h2><ul><li><h3>Know the job you are applying for</h3></li></ul><p>The first point towards writing a great resume should be based on the type of job you are looking for. Recruiters rarely go spend more than a minute reviewing a resume. Based on research, out of <strong>100</strong> <strong>applications, 20-25 make it to the hiring manager. And out of them, only 4-5 get shortlisted for an interview</strong>. Candidates should, therefore, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/job-resumes-4073657">focus on making all your strengths and experience stand out</a> in the limited window of opportunity available.</p><ul><li><h3>Highlight your skills and accomplishments</h3></li></ul><p>A great resume helps reiterate focus on your traits or accomplishments, particularly those that might prove ideal for the particular job. The resume should be <strong>adjusted according to the requirements of each job</strong>. And make sure to convey that in the best manner possible. It can take anywhere from <strong>1-6 months to find a job</strong>. Hence, updating the resume on a periodical basis becomes essential in order to remain relevant with the up and coming trends of the industry.</p><ul><li><h3>Proofread your work</h3></li></ul><p>Last but not the least, proofread your resume to <strong>eliminate any typo or mistakes</strong>. This is a taxing job, even for <a href="https://makemyresume.co.in">experienced writers</a>. So, it is a good idea to have more eyes look through your resume before you send it in as part of your profile. A resume is your chronological document, living and breathing, with a life of its own.</p><p>Writing a <strong>great resume</strong> will help you stand out, making potential employers stand up and take notice. Remember, you only get one chance to strike the bull's eye. Therefore, make sure that all the years of valuable experience that you have accumulated are reflected in the best light possible.</p><p><em>Image Credit: Freepik</em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 26, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fwhy-do-you-need-a-great-resume%2F&amp;title=Why%20do%20you%20Need%20a%20Great%20Resume%3F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Why%20do%20you%20Need%20a%20Great%20Resume%3F https%3A%2F%2Fkavir10.github.io%2Fmakemyresume-blog%2Fwhy-do-you-need-a-great-resume%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/cover-letters-what-makes-a-good-one/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Cover letters - What makes a good one?</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/difference-between-cv-and-resume/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Difference between CV and Resume </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-02-28T12:48" class="feed__date">February 28, 2019</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/resume-skills-what-to-highlight-on-a-resume/" class="invert">Resume Skills: What to highlight on a Resume?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-11-13T17:27" class="feed__date">November 13, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/6-expert-tips-to-write-a-great-resume-work-experience/" class="invert">6 Expert Tips to Write a Great Resume Work Experience</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-08-09T11:32" class="feed__date">August 9, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/infographic-hereand039s-why-you-need-a-great-resume/" class="invert">INFOGRAPHIC: Here&amp;#039;s Why You need a Great Resume</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://kavir10.github.io/makemyresume-blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
