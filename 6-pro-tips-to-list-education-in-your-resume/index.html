It is what it is. Although, sometimes it can make things cloudy.</p><p>Follow these <strong>quick six tips</strong> to note down your education in the resume. They'll help you decide what to include, what to leave out, and what to do about the school you attended but didn't graduate.</p><h2>Tip 1: List your Highest Level of Education first in your Resume</h2><p>If you've got a master's degree, you start with that and then go back to your bachelors. Ideally, if you've earned a Master's degree or higher, it's okay to leave out your high school education.</p><p><em>For Eg: </em><em><b>Master of Science in Information Technology, </b>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 2007</em></p><p><em><b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, </b>University of Mumbai, 2005</em></p><h2>Tip 2: Selectively include your GPA &amp; Percentages</h2><p>Be sure to include your GPA only if it's higher than 3.0 and it's been less than three years since you graduated. The same applies to percentages, keep it to a first class. However, make an exception if the employer especially asks for your grades.</p><h2>Tip 3: Mention Academic Honors and Leadership Roles</h2><p>If you graduated within three years, it's is appropriate to include your academic honors or any leadership roles you have undertaken. However, leave them aside if they are religious, political or controversial. Furthermore, if you have more than three years of work experience, you can drop the school-related activities on your resume, unless they were awarded.</p><h2>Tip 4: If you attended college, but did not Graduate</h2><p>If you have attended college but did not graduate - yes this can be the case for some. Include the dates you attended, your accumulated credits towards the degree.</p><h2>Tip 5: Earned a Certification/License after Graduation</h2><p>If you've earned a license after graduation, and it's related to the job you're pursuing - make sure you add it to your resume under certifications or the license section.</p><h2>Tip 6: Elimination of graduation year if you're older</h2><p>Do you eliminate your graduation dates of you're older than forty years? It's a judgment you can take for yourself. By that age, you have accumulated enough <a href="http://makemyresume.co.in/blog/2018/11/resume-work-experience/">work experience</a>, that your academics may not seem important. However, it's advisable to include your graduation and higher degrees, if any. The inclusion of years is a call you make.</p><p><em>Image Credit: Freepik</em></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 26, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fguide.makemyresume.co.in%2F6-pro-tips-to-list-education-in-your-resume%2F&amp;title=6%20Pro%20Tips%20to%20List%20Education%20in%20your%20Resume" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=6%20Pro%20Tips%20to%20List%20Education%20in%20your%20Resume https%3A%2F%2Fguide.makemyresume.co.in%2F6-pro-tips-to-list-education-in-your-resume%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/authors/makemyresume/" class="invert" rel="author">MakeMyResume</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/3-quick-tips-to-include-volunteer-experience-in-your-resume/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 3 Quick Tips to Include Volunteer Experience in your Resume</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/how-to-include-certifications-on-your-resume/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How to Include Certifications on your Resume </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-02-22T19:37" class="feed__date">February 22, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/why-do-you-need-a-great-resume/" class="invert">Why do you Need a Great Resume?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-11-01T12:38" class="feed__date">November 1, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/resume-types-functional-and-chronological-resume/" class="invert">Resume Types - Functional and Chronological Resume</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-09-27T13:19" class="feed__date">September 27, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/leveraging-your-linkedin-profile-to-the-fullest-part-2/" class="invert">Leveraging Your LinkedIn Profile to the Fullest! - Part 2</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2021 Quantum Careers Tech Pvt Ltd</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://guide.makemyresume.co.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
